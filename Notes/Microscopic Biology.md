## Elements

###### Composition of Organisms
92% of an average organism consists of:
- Oxygen
- Carbon
- Hydrogen
- Calcium
- Nitrogen
- Phosphorus

---

###### Chemical Bonds
- Covalent Bonds:
	- The strongest chemical bond
	- Most common bond
	- Electrically neutral
	- Shares electrons
- Ionic Bonds:
	- Loss or gain of electrons from ions to form a stable compound
- Hydrogen Bonds:
	- Weak, easily broken
	- Slightly polar; attractive to other slightly polar molecules

---

###### Acids
- Yields H+ ions in solution
- Strong -> HCl or hydrochloric acid
- Weak --> milk
- 0 to 6.99 on pH scale
- Causes pain and tissue necrosis do to fat hydrolysis - instant

---

###### Bases
- Yields H- ions in solution
- Strong --> drain cleaner
- Weak --> blood, sweat
- 7.01 to 14 on pH scale
- Usually causes delayed pain via protein denaturation

## Water

Water is considered to be the universal solvent for life

Takes loads of energy to heat water up:
- Human body can resist overheating for a relatively long time because of the water content
- Loads of energy for water to evaporate
- Hydrogen bonds in sweat break and release heat, cooling the organism cools down

Solid water expands = ice

Frostbite:
- Freezing of water inside cells punctures the cells
- cell death
- leads to tissue death


###### Cohesion

- Water Molecules stick together because of hydrogen bonds

###### Surface Tension

- The resistance water has to being "Broken"

###### Adhesion

- Sticky to slightly charged surfaces
- Allows plants/trees to deliver water hundreds of feet against gravity
- Allows water in plasma to be returned to heart from your big toe

###### Hydrophobic

- "Water fearing" 
- Parts of membranes

###### Hydrophilic

- "Water Loving"
- Molecules that are attracted to water
- Many biological compounds
- Parts of membranes
