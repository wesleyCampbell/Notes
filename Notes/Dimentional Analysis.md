# Dimensional Analysis

Allows us to see what dimension we are working in.

| Base Quantity             | Symbol for Dimension |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Length                    | L                    |
| Mass                      | M                    |
| Time                      | T                    |
| Current                   | I                    |
| Thermodynamic temperature | Omega                |
| Amount of substance       | N                    |
| Luminous intensity        | J                    |

When looking at dimension, we use \[] square brackets to symbolize it.

For example, if we have a cylinder of radius *r* and height *h*, then we would do

- \[*r*] = L
- \[*h*] = L
to symbolize that both *r* and *h* are 1-dimensional measurements of length.

**Dimensionally Consistent**
1. Each term in an expression must be of the same dimensions. 
2. The following functions require pure numbers (or dimension 0):
	- trigonometric functions
	- logarithms
	- exponential functions

If either of the two laws listed above are false, then the expression *cannot* be an accurate statement of physical law. 

By analyzing expressions through this method, we are able to figure out a expressions dimension.

**Calculus' Effect on Dimension**
When taking the derivative of an expression, the dimension will be as follows:
- \[dv/dt] = \[v]/\[t]

When taking the integral of an expression, the dimension will be as follows:
- int(v, t) = \[v] * \[t]
