### What is Learning?

A Definition: "Learning is any relatively permanent change in behavior brought about by experience or practice"

It is possible that when you learn something, it is physically stored in your brain.

There is a difference between *maturation* and learning.

### Classical Conditioning

**Key Figures:**
- Pavlov (Dogs)
- John B. Watson and Rayner (Little Albert)

There are stimuluses that can cause responses. In the case of Pavlov's dogs, the food was the stimulus and the salivation was the response. 

A definition: Learning to elicit an involuntary response to an unnatural stimulus.

Elements of Classical Conditioning:
- Unconditioned stimulus: There must be a stimulus to hijack
- Unconditioned response: There must be a natural response to a stimulus
- Conditioned stimulus: Any stimulus can be associated with the unconditioned stimulus
- Conditioned response: The response to the Conditioned stimulus

Pavlov's experiment with the dogs involved pairing a neutral stimulus (the metronome) with the presentation of food (UCS). 

- Stimuli can be *generalized*: similar stimuli will be grouped together.
- Stimuli can also be *discrimitated*: When the consequence only occurs with one specific stimulus, other stimuli can be learned to ignored. 
- When the CS is repeated without the UCS, it will die out. This is called *extinction*.
- *Spontaneous Recovery*  can occur after a period of time.

It is possible to pair two stimuli in a process known as *higher order conditioning*.

Conditioned Emotional Response (Little Albert)
Vicarious Conditioning is also possible.

### Operant Conditioning

While classical conditioning applies to involuntary behavior, operant conditioning applies to *voluntary* behavior.

**Key Figures**:
- Thorndike (Hungry Cat)
- Skinner (Rats with the lever)

If an action is followed by a good consequence, it will be repeated.
If an action is followed by a bad consequence, it won't be repeated.

"If I do this, what's in it for me?" Reinforcement.

Positive reinforcement: Adding something pleasant
Negative reinforcement: Removing something unpleasant

**Primary Reinforcer**: A reinforcer that fulfills a basic need such as hunger.
**Secondary Reinforcer**: Get's its reinforcement powers by being associated with primary reinforcers in the past, such as money.


**Continuous Reinforcement:** reinforcement happens continually
**Partial Reinforcement**: reinforcement only happens part of the time
- **Fixed Interval Reinforcement**: You get the reinforcement at a fixed time interval
- **Variable Rate Reinforcement**: You don't know when the reinforcement is coming
- **Fixed Ratio Reinforcement**: Reinforcement comes after every nth time
- **Variable Interval Reinforcement**: A variation in the amount of time reinforcements are received.

Partial reinforcement is slower to learn, but also lasts longer than continuous reinforcement.

**Punishment**: Use punishment to stop behavior
- Positive Punishment: Adding something unpleasant
- Negative Punishment: Removing something pleasant

Punishment can happen in two methods:
- Punishment by application: Something unpleasant is applied
- Punishment by removal: removing something pleasurable

Discriminative stimulus: Provides a cue for making a certain response to obtain reinforcement

Applied behavior: Using conditioning to foster a desired behavior

### Cognitive Learning Theory

Studying how human thought influences our learning

**Key Figures**:
- Edward Tolman (Latent learning rats)
- Wolfgang Köhler (Chimps)
- Martin Seligman (Shocking dogs)

**Latent Learning**: Learning can happen without reinforcement, but may not be demonstrated until there is a need to.

Köhler's Studies:
By using chimps solving puzzles, Köhler determined that *insight* could not be gained through trial and error alone.

Seligman's Studies:
By applying shocks to two groups of dogs (one able to stop the shock and the other not), Seligman discovered that the dogs who were not able to escape the shock previously chose not to try when an opportunity presented itself. Research by Steven Maier suggests that this is due to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex of the brain.

### Observational Learning

Learning from observing.

The four elements of observational learning:
1. Attention
2. Memory
3. Imitation
4. Desire
