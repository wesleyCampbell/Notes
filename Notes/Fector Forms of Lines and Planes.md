###### Normal Form of a Line and Plane

$$
\vec n\cdot \vec x = \vec n\cdot\vec p
$$
Where $\vec n$ is the normal vector, $\vec x =\left [\begin{matrix} x & y & z\end{matrix} \right ]$, and $\vec p$ is a specific point on the line or plane

###### Vector Form of a Line and Plane

**Line**:
$$
\vec x = \vec p + t\vec u
$$

**Plane**:
$$\vec x = \vec p + t\vec u + s\vec v$$

Where $\vec p$ is a specific point on the line or plane, $\vec u\space\space\vec v$ are direction vectors, and $t\space\space s$ are scalars.
