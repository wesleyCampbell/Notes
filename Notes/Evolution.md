## A Simplistic Introduction

1. There is variation among individuals
2. Variation is inherited
3. Natural Selection maintains inherited characteristics (genes) that help the individual survive and thrive


### Principles of Evolution
- History of Evolutionary Thought
- Evidence of Darwin's Theory
- Addition of Mendel's Genetics'
- Addition of Watson & Crick's DNA
- NeoDarwinian Synthesis

## History of Evolutionary Thought 

#### Biology Before the 18th Century
- There was a single system of thought
- Three cornerstones:
	1. Fixity of species (zebras have always looked like a zebra, and never will change)
	2. There is a hierarchical organization
	3.  Natural theology

###### Fixity of Species
- A working scientific theory
- Empirical evidence and philosophical ideas
- Discrete boundaries between species
- Species are static
- Species did not change over the history of the world
- No extinction

###### Hierarchical Organization of Species
- Species fall into natural groups (genus, family, class, etc.)
- First mentioned by Aristotle

###### Natural Theology
- All Creation due to activities of Christian God
- Discovering Nature is the same as discovering God

###### Problems With the Cornerstones:
- Variability within species
- Some things didn't fit a known species
- Fossil record of extinct species
	- Did God make a mistake? Did He make imperfect things?
- Geologic evidence that the Earth was much older than 7 days
	- Collision with literal interpretation of Bible

#### Darwin and Wallace

###### Charles Darwin:
- Son of wealthy doctor
- studied medicine 
- joined the Anglican clergy
- influenced by Naturalist Professors
- passed exams, signed on to *Beagle*

###### H.M.S. Beagle
- A five year mission to chart the South American coast
- Naturalist funded by the crown and captain, but Darwin's Father picked up the bill
- Variation of organisms between islands 
	- An example of separate creations?
- Discovers lots of fossils (marine fossils found on mountains)
- Species doing the same things across the different islands
- Darwin spent the next 10-15 years sorting the materials from the voyage
- Darwin then published a 5 year work on travels, *Voyage of the Beagle* in 1838

###### Darwin's Publications
- Darwin Wrote his notebook in 1838
- Darwin received the letter from Wallace in 1858
- Darwin, worried that Wallace will scoop him, publishes *The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection* in 1859
- Never finished a larger manuscript

###### Alfred Russel Wallace
- Son of a lower class laborer
- Worked for a position to explore
- Financed his own trip to South American
- Collected tons of materials, but the ship sank
- Financed his own trip to Malaysia
- He writes to Darwin in 1858 on his sickbed
- Became ardent supporter of Darwin
- Father of biogeography

###### Wallace's Publications
- Letter to Darwin from sickbed in 1858
- Lyell had Darwin's and Wallace's papers read in Royal Society in 1858
- Unimpressive; "nothing of interest happened that year"
- The *Origin* in 1859

###### Challenges to the Theory
- Lord Kelvin:
	- Not enough time to account for this much change
- Henry Fleming Jenkin:
	- Blending of inheritance would always water down any new mutations
- Darwin's Reaction:
	- Pangenesis 
	- No evidence for the above

## Components of Natural Selection

#### Principles:
- There is variation within a species
	- There are the most important variants
	- There are the not ideal or essential forms
- The variation is inherited:
	- The mechanism of inheritance is unknown
	- Use/disuse is inherited
- There is a struggle for existence:
	- Every organism has intense struggle
	- Population size is not subject to change, but competition
	- Very complex set of interactions
	- The ultimate goal is maximum reproduction and successful progeny
	- Natural Selection acted on by environment sufficient to cause evolution  = change

## Evidence of Natural Selection:

###### Artificial Selection:
- Humans select traits
- Modify the traits through modification
- Many different breeds of dogs

###### Comparative Anatomy:
- Compares forelimbs of all vertebrates
- Organisms from different ancestries having the same forms and structures in the same environment
- Whales and snakes still have pelvic girdles

###### Embryology
- Ontology recapitulates phylogeny
- Entiene Serres (1824)
- Look at the different stages of embryo development to clue in on evolutionary changes in a particular species

###### Geographical Distribution
- Marsupials and placentals
- Two "ideal" forms?
- Two groups separated by geography 
- "descent with modifications through natural selection"

###### Fossils 
- Progression of fossil forms
- The shallower the fossil, the more it looks like the present form
- Horses

## NeoDarwinian Synthesis
- Reconciled natural selection with Mendelism
- Mendel "re-discovered" in 1901
- Inheritance is not blended, but particulate
- Differential proliferation of phenotypes:
	- There are winners and there are losers
	- Members with disadvantaged phenotypes die off
- Natural selection could change gene frequencies
- More successful genotype = more successful offspring
- Success = survival and reproduction

###### Vestigial Structures:
- Maintaining structures that don't serve any purpose
- Hind limb bones where no hind limbs exist
- Whale and snake pelvic structures

Watch out for convergent evolution and analogous structures
- Concurrent Evolution:
	- Anatomical similarities not derived from common ancestry
	- Analogous Structures:
		- Structures with a similar function, but dissimilar anatomy
