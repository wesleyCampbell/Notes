### Motivation

**Extrinsic Motivation**: Motivation outside of the person, like a monetary reward.

**Intrinsic Motivation**: Internally satisfying emotion due to performing an action.

**Drive-Reduction Theory**:
Humans try to eliminate tension brought about by needs.
We are constantly trying to achieve homeostasis. 

Primal drives are about things essential for survival.
Acquired drives are learned, or conditioned, drives about things we have learned that we need such as money.

**McClelland's Theory**:
Motivation is about three things:
- Affiliation
- Power
- Achievement

People high in the need for affiliation care most about their relationships with other people.
People high in the need for power care most about having power and influence over others.
People high in the need for achievement care most about achieving goals. 

**Carol Dweck's Theory**:
People are motivated by their perception of themselves.

Children praised on thinking hard or their methods are more likely to stay motivated after failure.
Children praised on their smartness are more likely to give up after a failure. 

**Arousal Theory**:
There is an optimal level of arousal for each person, and they strive to find it.
Someone who isn't stressed about at test won't study needs more stress, for example, while someone incredibly stressed will want to reduce stress. 

**Incentive Approaches**:
People are influenced by external pulls or pushes.
For example, someone who is full may choose to have a slice of cake.
Someone who is hungry may choose a candy bar over celery. 

**Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs**:

**Self-Determination Theory**:

Three things help people gain a complete sense of self and healthy relationships with others.
- Autonomy: The need to be in control of one's own behavior and goals
- Competence: the need to be able to master challenging tasks
- Relatedness: the need to feel a sense of belonging with others

**Stressors**:
Things that add stress

**Conflicts**:
When someone has to choose between incompatible goals.
- Approach-approach conflict:
	- Choose between two attractive goals
- Avoidance-avoidance conflict:
	- Choose between two unpleasant goals
- Approach-avoidance conflict:
	- One goal has both attractive and unpleasant aspects

**Coping Strategies**:
Actions to master, tolerate, reduce, or minimize the effect of stressors.
- Problem-Focused Coping:
	- Try to eliminate or reduce the impact of a stressor
- Emotion-Focused Coping:

### Hunger

Hormones:
- Insulin: Reduces glucose in bloodstream
- Glucagon: Increases glucose in bloodstream
- Leptin: Signals the hypothalamus that body has enough food

**Obesity**:
Obesity is classified as having a BMI from 30.0 to 30.9.

Heredity can have an effect. 
Negatively correlated with cognitive tasks including verbal memory and executive function.

### Emotion

**Physiological**:

Fear response controlled by amygdala.

Low road:
- Quick response for things that are dangerous
High Road:
- Slower response, more involved cortical.

**Behavior**:
Facial expressions same for all humans. 

**Subjective**:
Labeling the emotion.

**Common Sense Theory**:
Feeling a particular emotion first was the physical reaction then a behavioral one. 

**James-Lange Theory**:
Stimulus -> behavioral -> physical

**Cannon-Bard Theory**:
Subcortical brain activity causes both physical and behavioral at the same time.

**Facial Feedback Hypothesis**:
Facial expressions provide feedback to the brain

**Cognitive Arousal Theory**:
Physical arousal and cognitive appraisal happen at the same time, leading to the emotion

**Cognitive-Mediational Theory**:
Appraisal of threat leads to emotion leads to bodily response.
