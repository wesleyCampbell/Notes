### Humanistic Approach

Humanists focus on conscious, subjective experiences.

**Rogers' Person-Centered Therapy**:

	- Planning to implement change

**Gestalt Therapy**:

## Cognitive Therapies

Focusing on helping people change the way they think.

Depression is explained by schemas, thinking errors, and the *cognitive triad*

**The Cognitive Triad**:
- Three types of automatic, negative thoughts a depressed individual has
- Negative views of themselves, the world, and the future

**Beck's Cognitive Therapy**:
- Arbitrary inference
	- Jumping to conclusions with no evidence
	- "Suzy canceled our lunch date--I'll bet she's mad at me!"
- Selective Thinking:
	- focuses on one aspect of a situation
- Overgeneralization:
	- Draws a sweeping conclusion from one incident
	- Assumes the conclusion applies to unrelated areas of life
- Magnification and Minimization:
	- Blows bad things out of proportion
	- Minimizing good things
- Personalization:
	- Takes responsibility for events unconnected to themselves
- Therapists looks at their believes and tests them for validity

**Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy**:
- Critical thinking applied to one's own thoughts and beliefs
- Focusses on the present rather than the past
- Assumes disorders come from illogical, irrational cognitions
- Changing thinking patterns will relieve symptoms
- The three goals:
	1. Relieve the symptoms and help clients resolve the problems
	2. Help clients develop strategies to cope with future problems
	3. Help clients change the way they think from irrational, self-defeating thoughts to more rational, self-helping, positive thoughts

**Ellis and Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy**:
- Albert Ellis
- Clients are taught a way to challenge their own irrational beliefs

## Biomedical Therapies

### Psychopharmacology

The use of drugs to control symptoms.

#testmaterial 
Prozac, Zoloft, Lexapro, and Paxil are used to treat depression.

SSRIs: The most widely used form of treatment for depression 
Women are more likely to both have depression and take antidepressants. 

How Prozac--and other SSRIs--works:
- Serotonin is deactivated in the synapse by reuptake into the presynatpic neuron.
- Prozac blocks the reuptake of serotonin, thus increasing the activation of serotonin receptors. 


**Antipsychotic Drugs**:
- Drugs used to treat psychotic symptoms
- Typical Antipsychotics
	- Caused neurolepsis
	- Referred to as neuroleptics
	- Work by blocking certain dopamine receptors
	- Affect other systems that use dopamine
	- Cause disorders similar to Parkinson's
	- Facial tics
- Atypical Antipsychotics
	- Suppress dopamine to a greater degree of accuracy 
	- weight gain
	- type 2 diabetes
	- blood lipid level changes 
	- changes in the rhythm of the heart

**Antianxiety Drugs**:
- Minor tranquilizers or benzodiazepines
- Xanax, Ativan, and Valium
- Sedative effect
- antihistamines
- atypical benzodiazepines
- buspar

**Mood-Stabilizing Drugs**:
