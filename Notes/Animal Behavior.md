#### Innate Behaviors
- Behavior is completed correctly the first time without instruction
- Instinctual based

#### Learned Behaviors
- Behavior that requires experience to complete
- Habits, nurture
- Can be modified

---

## Modified Learning

#### Habituation:
- Getting used to a stimulus
- less stress

#### Conditioning
- Reward and punishment

#### Insight
- Problem solving without experience
-

## No Boundary Between Innate and Learned

Instincts can be changed through experience.
Learning may be limited by instinct.
Some combination of genes and environment
Most behaviors are plastic, not static.


#### Imprinting:
- Learning only at a specified development

## Communication

#### Visual
- Silent
- Fast
- Quickly changed
- ATP expensive
- Conspicuous
- Relies on sight

#### Audio
- Fast
- Don't have to see it
- Quickly changed
- Variety of mensajes
- Conspicuous

#### Chemical
- Pheromones: Chemical signals between same species
- Long distance
- Can be long time frame
- ATP cheap
- Simple messages
- Hard to modify

#### Touch
- Creates social bonds
- **Very** important in primates
- Inter and intra species
- Short distance
- Part of sexual reproduction
- Can be dangerous

## Competition

Not enough resources to keep up with reproductive potential

Intra-species aggressive behavior
- Individuals of same species
- Competition is the most fierce
- Fight might result in injury, thus displays
- Visual/audio size-up

## Dominance/Submissive Relationships

#### Ranking:
- Individuals are ranked
- Rank related to resources
	- Mates
	- Food
	- Space
- Disputes are rare, typically solved through display

#### Territories:
- Individuals defend a resource area
- Advertisement: "This is mine!"
- Males, females, pairs, groups
- Expensive to maintain
- winner is usually the defender
- Mates may be territorial
- Sight, sound, chemical

#### Mates

#### Qualification
- Same species
- Opposite gender
- Viable genetics
- Receptive individual

#### Audio
- Calls that advertise species and sex
- Calls that advertise quality

#### Visual
- Displays that advertise species and sex
- Displays that advertise quality

#### Chemical
- Advertise species and sex
- Advertise quality and receptiveness

#### Social Group Behavior
- Benefits:
	- Anti-predator
	- Hunting/gathering
	- Division of labor
	- Easier to find mates
- Costs:
	- Lots of competition
	- Disease
	- Infanticide
	- Conspicuous as a group, but hide in the crowd
