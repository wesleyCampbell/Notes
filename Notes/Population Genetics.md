###### Population:
- All individuals living in a given geographical area
-

###### Gene Pool:
- All of the genes of a population

**Evolution is a change of allele frequencies within a population over time/generations**

**NO EVOLUTION**:
- Hardy-Weinberg Principle:
	- Allele Frequencies and genotype frequencies remain unchanged

###### Condition for Hardy-Weinberg:
- No mutation
- No gene flow 
	- No immigration
	- No emigration
- Very large population
- Completely random mating
- No natural selection/No differential fitness

###### Mutations
- Mutations are a source of variation
- Are extremely rare, but can accumulate over long, long periods of time
- Random chance whether it is helpful, harmful, or neutral

###### Gene Flow
- Movement of alleles to/from another population
- Rampant modern humans
- Plant populations as well

###### Population Size/Genetic Drift
- Some random event that removes some alleles from a small population
- Bottleneck:
	- Population decreases due to an event resulting in allele decrease
- Founder Effect:
	- A small portion of a population "founds" a new area

###### Completely Random Mating
- Does not occur often

###### All Genotypes are Equally Successful
- Some, but not all
- Any trait that gives any kind of advantage will have increased success

## Natural Selection

###### Natural Selection
- "Survival of the fittest" = Herbert Spencer
- Natural Selection favors traits (alleles) that increase success
- Success is survival and reproduction
- Acts on phenotypes, but phenotypes and genotypes are closely linked

###### Evolutionary Success
- Successful phenotypes have the "good enough" adaptations
- Traits that help an organism survive and reproduce in a specific environment
- Living and non living components
- Not a perfect form
- There are living and non-living components to advantages
- Environment Specific

###### Competition
- The struggle for scarce resources
- The most severe between members of the same species and populations

###### Predator/Prey Interactions:
- Interaction is so strong that they exert selection pressures on each other
- Co evolution

###### Sexual Selection
- Selection that acts on traits that are used to acquire a mate
- Contests by males
- Preference by females

###### Effects of Natural Selection
- Directional
	- Favors individuals with one extreme of the bell curve

- Stabilizing:
	- Favors individuals with the average trait
	- Variation is reduced

- Disruptive:
	- Averages are selected against
	- Both extremes are selected for
