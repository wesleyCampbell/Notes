## My Notes on Medieval Pieces (For Recognition)

**Plainchant**

The music is vocal only.

There is no harmony.
Sung in unison.

More focused on movement than meter. 
No meter; the music flows rather than have a regular beat pattern.

Switches from Melismatic Text Setting to Syllabic Text Setting.

Melismatic Text Setting:
- Multiple notes per syllable 

Nuematic Text Setting:
- 2-4 notes per syllable

Syllabic Text Settings:
- 1 note per syllable

Recitation plainchant:
- Repeating the same pitch most of the piece

Monophonic Texture:
- No harmony; one note at a time
Polyphonic Texture:
- With harmony; more than one note occurring at a time. 

The most famous plainchant artist was Hildegard von Bingen of Germany.
- Was a nun; allowed to compose music.
- 1098-1179
- Her most famous piece:
	- Woman singing
		- goes up and down 
		- Responsory: starts with solo woman; women choir responds.


**Dies Irae**:
- Sung at a funeral Catholic Mass
- Meant to scare people into choosing righteousness
- Faster pace

## Church Music

The majority of written music preserved from the Middle Ages is church music.
This could be due to the fact that the clergy were literate and could record it.
Music was only preformed in the church and the court.

## Medieval Music Components
