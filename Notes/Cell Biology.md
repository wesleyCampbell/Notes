## Cell Theory

The cell is the fundamental unit of an organism

Organisms can be anywhere from single-cell to trillions of cells

All cells come from pre-existing 

###### Prokaryotic Cells
- Very simple, comparatively small
- Nearly all have a *cell wall* to promote shape made of carbohydrates
- Have an outer capsule for surface attachment. Kind of like Velcro
- Some have flagella (little tail things) for movement
- Have *pili* for transfer of gametes (DNA) between other cells
- Have DNA, but they don't have a membrane on the nucleus:
	- An unbound nucleoid
- Single, circular chromosome (DNA)
- Some have "free-floating" rings of DNA
	- Called *Plasmid*
- *Ribosomes* for protein synthesis
- Can be in various shapes:
	- Tic tac: (Bacillus)
	- Squiggle (Spirilla) 
	- Spheres (Cocci)

###### Eukaryotic Cells
- This is me! I am an eukaryotic organism
- Some have cell walls (plants and fungi) for support and protection
- Some have *cilia*(hair legs) and *flagella* for locomotion
- Have a cytoskeleton:
	- A framework inside the cytoplasm
	- Similar to a steel girder system in a building
	- Follow the cytoskeleton for shape
	- Cells follow the cytoskeleton 
	- Organelle movement
	- Important in cell division
- Nucleus:
	- Control center of the cell
	- Contains the DNA for the cell
	- Membrane bound organelle
	- Chromosomes: strands of DNA within the nucleus. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes
	- Nucleolus: 
		- Core in the nucleus. Makes the ribosomes for the cell
- Ribosomes:
	- Built in the nucleolus move to the cytoplasm and build proteins from amino acids
- Golgi:
	- The fed-ex of the system
	- Receives, sorts, builds, stores, and send proteins from the ER () to other destinations
- Vesicles:
	- Carry special contents like waste and other proteins along to the cell membranes
	- Like packages
- Lysosomes:
	- Carry hydrolytic enzymes to digest large molecules
	- Full of enzymes that will break things apart
	- Helps digest really large molecules
- Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER):
	- Produces membrane proteins and new phospholipids 
	- Smooth ER:
		- No ribosomes on the ER
		- Steroid production
		- Detox enzymes in liver
		- Calcium storage
	- Rough ER:
		- Long chains of ribosomes for protein production attached to ER
	- Products are budded off of the ER to the Golgi (the fed-ex of the cell)
- Mitochondria:
	- The powerhouse of the cell
	- Produces ATP with/without Oxygen
	- Mitochondria also have their own DNA from the mother's side
	- Theory of mitochondria as descendant of an independent bacteria as a symbiont
	- 

###### Plant Cells:
- Eukaryotic Cells
- Have a cell wall
- Chloroplasts contain chlorophyll where photosynthesis occurs
- Plastids act in seasonal food storage and contain seasonal pigments
- Have a central vacuole acts as a water pump, hazmat site, food storage, and pigment reserve
	- Turgor pressure: the maximum pressure inside the vacuole

## Cell Components

###### Plasma Membrane
- Separates the outside from the inside
- Functions as a gatekeeper for materials
- Communication with other cells
- Is a phospholipid layer.
- Comprised of polar heads and non-polar tails.

###### Cytoplasm
- The "goo" inside the cell, but outside the nucleus
- Enzyme and other protein synthesis happens here
- Can't see it with a normal microscope

###### Nucleus
- Center of the cell?
- Contains the DNA and RNA of the cell

## Heredity

DNA and RNA are genetic material.
Contain the instructions to make another you.

All information to produce:
- New proteins
- New nuclei
- New "daughter" cells
