## The Origins of Humanity

The first *hominin* skeleton found is named Lucy. 

The first modern humans were beings of culture: they were not bound to evolution as their predecessors were.  They had the ability to write their *own* history rather than history writing it for them. 

Human development was not accidental. It was both predictable and spontaneous 
We evolved through *interactions* and *adaptations*.
- These produce the innovations that drive history.

	- Sugar
	- Opium
	- The Internet

We are the descendants of human-like primates called *hominins*.
Prehistory is important to study in the context of history.

The climate played a large role in how the primates evolved. 

>Hominins: Forerunners of the human kind after splitting of from the chimpanzee evolutionary line. Any group of humans or their ancestors. 

The hominins emerged about 5 million years ago.

The first *Hominin* was the **Ardis**. While they primarily lived in the rain forest, their ability to walk biped allowed them to venture out into the less dense savannas while the other apes remained in the rain forest. As a result, these apes were only able to knuckle walk shorter distances.

>Australopiths: A species before the genus *Homo*. This species was of the genus *Australopithecus*

Later, the *Ardis* were replaced by the *australopiths*. This species was much more comfortable walking on the ground, but they still remained in the rain forests.

>Bipedalism: The ability to walk distances on two hind legs. This was the first human characteristic of the *Hominins*

***Bipedalism*** was a key evolutionary advantage for the *hominins*. It allowed the *hominins* to expend less energy while walking and allowed for the arms to perform tasks at the same time. 

>Oldowan toolmaking: The practice of splitting rocks to make tools.

It was the making of stone tools that marks the beginning of the ***Paleolithic*** (Old Stone Age) When the climate had a dry spell, *Homo erectus* became the top hominin. This new species was fully biped, and had lost the ability to climb trees. They were capable for walking long distances, and were thus prepared for the current climate. Fire was mastered by the *homo erectus*. 

The *homo erectus* mastered walking and the use of fire about 1 million years ago.

Additionally, the *homo erectus* graduated from oldowan toolmaking and adopted instead *acheulian toolmaking*.

>Acheulian toolmaking: A technique of chipping the edges of a hard rock--such as flint or obsidian--to hold an edge.

The *homo erectus* line may not have originated from Africa. It is possible that the earlier species of hominins lead the mass exodus out of Africa.

## Human Adaptation from Africa to Eurasia and Australia

### Development of the *Homo Sapiens*

There were several different lineages from ancient *homo sapiens* to modern-day.

The distinction from *homo sapiens* from *homo erectus*:
- Rapidly developing technological skills
- The ability to develop a unique culture
- Hunting (especially larger animals)
- Gathered in caves and overhangs for shelter
- **Developed non-utilitarian objects**: the decisive step where *homo sapiens* left the world of animals behind
	- Jewelry 
	- Symbols
	- Art
- Better communication. Unlike the *Neanderthals*, *homo sapiens* had more developed vocal chords. This allowed them to be more *social and communal.*

These values allowed the *homo sapiens* to become much more versitile. 

Even though humans were still subject to the *effects* of nature, their culture allowed them to control their surroundings. The development of *Levallois toolmaking* allowed them to transition from scavengers to hunters. Foraging (hunting and gathering) remained the primary source of food for several hundred thousand years. Their diets increasingly included meat.

>Levallois toolmaking: A technique where hard rock was shaped first into a cone or cylinder. Developed by the *homo sapiens*

Eventually, humans began fishing and storing seed; with an increased amount of settlements, trade began to thrive. When *homo sapiens* began expanding from crafting tools to non-essential items, they left behind the world of animals and early humans. They began to understand mental concepts such as symbolism.
Grave sites were found as was evidence of a belief in the afterlife.

After the *homo sapiens* were fully equipped with their technical skills and culture, they were able to adapt to almost any climate. It is widely believed that this group came up out of Africa and spread over the face of the planet in the next 70,000 years. 

### Migration from South Asia to Australia

Australia was the only continent that foraged until the modern industrial age. It had a distinct culture from the rest of the world, but many things remained constant.

> Aboriginals: The people who originally settled in Australia 50,000-60,000 years ago.

Eel was a staple food in Australia. Hunters used controlled fires as a hunting tactic.
The Australian people lived in clans. Clans that were closely related to each other were grouped in *lineages*, and they would meet together once a year at sacred places to perform rituals and ceremonies.

#### The Dreamtime:
The elders of the lineage that held the most regard possessed a deep knowledge of the *dreamtime*. The dreamtime was the Aboriginals' stories and myths of the creation. It was believed that Elders could see this time through a *trance state*. Magic and sorcery was believed in by the aboriginals. 

Because the elders were unable to obtain enough wealth to pay for soldiers, the continent was stateless: there were no institutions. 

Rock paintings were developed independent from each other in Europe and Australia. 

### Migration from Asia to Europe

When *homos sapiens* arrived in Europe, they discovered that another human line, the *Neanderthals* had already arrived. There are many artifacts and rock paintings that we have found from the *homo sapiens*.

## Ice Age Crisis and Human Migration to the Americas

Modern humanity has endured two ice ages, and utilized them to migrate. 

***The Americas' first inhabitants arrived 16k-13.5k years ago***

Many species were unable to survive the change in climate include *Neanderthals*, *mastodons*, *wooly mammoths*, etc.
The Neanderthals were reliant upon a warm, wet climate for survival.
Canoes were developed, which allowed for a greater degree of trade to commence.

At the coldest point in the ice age, humans were able to migrate to the Americas through Alaska. 

This *deep history* consists of the VAST majority of human history. It isn't even close.
