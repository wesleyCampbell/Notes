# Electrical Attraction

**Electric Charge and Attraction**:
- Like charges *repel*
- Unlike charges *attract*
- Weak *attraction* between neutral and charge

**Force**

Coulomb's law:

$\vec F_{1\to 2}^E = k\frac{q_1\cdot q_2}{r_{1\to 2}^2}\cdot \hat r_{1\to 2}$

Where $\hat r$ is the unit vector from 1 to 2

### Electrical Force of Bodies with Uniform Charge Distribution

When we are not dealing with a particle, we need to be able to find the overall electrical field from a body. To do so, we divide the body into infinitesimally small sections with charge $dq_s$

Using Coulombs Law, we see that the electric field at point, P, from the source, s, can be calculated as:
$$
d\vec E_s(P) = k\frac{dq_s}{r_{s\to P}^2}\hat r_{s\to P}
$$

To calculate the overall force at a point, P, we need to take an integral of the charge over the body:
$$
\vec E = \int d\vec E_s = k\int \frac{dq_s}{r_{s\to P}^2}\hat r_{s\to P}
$$

## Electrical Fields

An easier way of depicting the electrical force from objects is by using a vector field around a charged object depicting the electrical force per unit of charge, or a vector field with units of $\frac Nq$.

However, unlike a gravitational field, electrical fields can have two directions, so it is custom to depict positive particles as repelling and negative fields attracting:
