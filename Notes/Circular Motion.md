Equations for finding the position, velocity, and acceleration of objects in circular motion.

#### **Centripetal Acceleration**:
$$a_c=\frac{v^2}{r}=\omega ^2r$$

Where $r$ is the radius, $v$ the velocity, and $\omega$ is the angular velocity 
Always points toward the center of the circle.

#### Position, Velocity, and Acceleration
$$
\vec{r}=A\cos({\omega t})\hat i + A\sin({\omega t})\hat j
$$
$$
\vec v=-A\omega\sin(\omega t)\hat i + A\omega\cos(\omega t)\hat j
$$
$$
\vec a = -\omega^2\cdot\vec r
$$
Where $A$ Is the radius of the circle and $\omega$ is angular velocity

#### Non-Uniform Circular Motion

Acceleration can be calculated by adding the centripetal acceleration and the tangential acceleration.

$$\vec a = \vec a_c + \vec  a_t$$
