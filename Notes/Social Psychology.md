Studying how groups interact with each other.

The scientific study of how a person's thoughts, feelings, and behavior are influenced by the real, imagined, or implied presence of others.

Includes how we see ourselves as a social being. 

## Social Influence

### Conformity

Conformity: Changing one's own behavior to more closely match the actions of others.

Confederates: subjects introduced to give answers to change other's responses. 

Conformity is more about peer-pressure than authority.

**Sherif's Study**:
- A point of light
- A confederate changed others answers just by giving a value
- Widely critiqued

**Asch's Study**:
- 7 participants, 6 of which were confederates
- Comparing line lengths
- Confederates all picked the same incorrect answer
- Factors that influenced conformity:
	- Number of participants and dissenters (any more than four dissenters had no further affect)
	- Culture
	- Sex (A minimal difference)
	- Private (private responses  less likely to conform)

**Groupthink**:
- Dangerous, obviously
- 

Characteristics of Groupthink: 

| Characteristic        | Description                                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Invulnerability       | Members feel that they cannot fail                                  |
| Rationalization       | Members explain away warning signs                                  |
| Lack of Introspection | Members do not examine the ethical implications                     |
| Stereotyping          | Members stereotype their enemies as weak, stupid, or unreasonable   |
| Pressure              | Members pressure each other not to question the narrative           |
| Lack of Disagreement  | Members do not express opinions that differ from the narrative      |
| Self-Deception        | Members share in the illusion that they all agree with the decision |
| Insularity            | Members prevent the group from hearing contradictory information                                                                    |

### Compliance

Marketing, advertising, salesmen all use psychology to try and promote obedience

**Foot-in-the-Door Technique**:
- Start with a small request
- Start adding larger requests on top of it 
- People want to behave consistently with their previous response

**Door-in-the-Face Technique**:
- Start with a large request
- When refused, start downscaling the requests with more reasonable requests

**Lowball Technique**:
- Start with a low-cost request
- Begin ramping it up

---

### Obedience

Obedience: Changing one's behavior at the direct order of an authority figure.
Different from compliance.

**Milgram's Research**:
- Told participants he was testing the effects of punishment on learning behavior
- When the learner got a problem wrong, he was shocked by the "teacher"
- After each shock, the voltage increased
- 65% of the teachers went up to 450V. (Predicted max of 150V)
- None of the "teachers" stopped when the learner protested
- protestor not actually shocked
- Pushbacks:
	- "foot-in-the-door" technique used
	- Teacher and learner labels

### Social Cognition

## Attitudes

Attitude: A tendency to respond positively or negatively toward a certain idea, person, object, or situation.
Attitudes are poor predictors of actual behavior.

**ABC Model**:
- Affect (feelings)
- Behavior (Actions)
- Cognition (thoughts)

**Affective Component**:
- The way a person feels toward the object
- The emotional response

**Behavior Component**:
- The action a person takes in response to the person, object, or situation.
- Purchasing a cd, or going to a concert, etc..

**Cognitive Component**:
- The way a person thinks about something.
- The thoughts are the focus of the attitude

**Formation of Attitudes**:
- Direct Contact
	- Attitude formed by direct contact with the object
	- Trying a gross food
- Direct Instruction
	- Attitude formed by direct instruction from some other individual
- Interaction with Others
	- Attitudes are formed by being around those with that attitude
- Vicarious Conditioning
	- Attitudes formed by observing others

### Persuasion

Persuasion: the process by which one person tries to change the attitude of another.

**Factors of Persuasion**:
- Source
	- The person delivering the message
	- Strong tendency to give more weight to people perceived as experts (ethos)
- Message:
	- Should be clear and well organized
	- The actual argument
	- Messages directing fear more effective (emotional manipulation)
- Target Audience:
	- The characteristics of those to whom the message is directed.
	- People who are in late-teens to mid-20s are found to be the most susceptible to persuasion
- Medium:
	- The form through which the message is delivered.
	- In person forms tend to be much more effective.

**Elaboration Likelihood Model**:
- People either elaborate or do not elaborate based on what they hear
- Central-route processing:
	- People attend to the content of the actual message
- Peripheral-route processing:
	- People rely on the peripheral cues such as the source, the length of the message, and other factors

### Cognitive Dissonance

Cognitive Dissonance: When people find themselves doing things that don't match with how they see themselves.
It is not a pleasant experience, and as such we seek to relieve the discomfort. 

Doctor Higley's missionary story example:
- missionaries experienced cognitive dissonance over anti-lds pamphlets 
- golden plates weight ==> not pure gold, probably some zinc alloy with some holes
- 

**Ways to Reduce Cognitive Dissonance**:
- Change the conflicting behavior to match their attitude
- Change their current attitude to justify their behavior (Most common, unfortunately)
- Minimize their responsibility for it
- Blame and/or dehumanize the victims

**Festinger and Carlsmith**:
- Each male participant given the hour-long task of sorting wooden spools and turning pegs
- Half of the males given $1 to convince the females that the task was enjoyable, the other half $20
- Those paid $1 more effective: 
	- They convinced themselves the task was fun
	- Didn't want to believe that they would lie for $1

### Formation of Impressions

The *primacy effect*: 
- The first time people meet someone, they form an impression of that person
- Often based upon physical appearance

**Social Categorization**:
- When we meet someone new, we assign them to a category
- A automatic process
- Result in stereotypes

**Implicit Personality Theory**:
- Sets of assumptions about how different types of people, traits, and actions are related

---

### Attribution

Attribution: The process of explaining both one's behavior and the behavior or others

**Attribution Theory**:
- Developed by Heider
- Two causes:
	- Behavior caused by external causes:
		- Situational causes
		- Behavior assumed to be caused by whatever situation the person is in
	- Behavior caused by internal causes
		- Dispositional cause
		- Internal personality attributes causing the behavior

**Fundamental Attribution Error**:
- The tendency for people to overestimate the influence of that person's internal characteristics on their behavior
