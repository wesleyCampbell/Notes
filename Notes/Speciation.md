## Biological Species Concept

A species are groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations, which are re-productively isolated from other such groups. 

#### Speciation

###### Requirements for Speciation:
- Population Isolation:
	- Prevents gene flow between two groups
- Genetic Divergence:
	- Development of large genetic differences
	- By chance = genetic drift
	- Natural selection = different environmental pressures

###### Ways to Speciate
- Allopatric Speciation:
	- Two populations are geographically separated
- Habitat Division:
	- Geographic, climate, or landscape change separate a population
	- Natural selection and genetic drift further isolates the population
- Sympatric Speciation:
	- Population isolation without geographic separation
	- Ecological Niche differences separate and stop gene flow
	- Example: Part of a fly population that lives only on hawthorne trees moves to an apple tree
- Mutation:
	- Rare
	- Can lead to instant speciation
- Adaptive Radiation:
	- Multiple speciation events in a short time
	- Populations invade a variety of new habitats

#### Extinction

When a species is wiped from the face of the earth.

###### Ways to Become Extinct
- Localized Distribution:
	- Species only found in a very small area
- Overspecialization:
	- The species can only survive and reproduce in a limited environment
- Species Interactions:
	- Competition and Predation
	- Species cannot successfully adapt to changing conditions
	- Introduced species outcompete or prey on native species

## Limits to Cross Species Mating

###### Pre-Mating Limits
- Mechanisms that prevent mating attempts
- Geography:
	- Can't mate if you can't meet
- Ecology:
	- Different populations use different resources
- Temporal:
	- Different populations are unable to mate due to the time / season
	- Different species mate at different times
- Behavioral:
	- Different populations use different display and courtship techniques to attract a mate
- Mechanical:
	- The reproductive organs are not compatible
	- Size, pollinated flowers, etc.


###### Post-Mating Mechanisms:
- Mating occurs, but it isn't viable
- Gametic incompatibility:
	- When mating occurs but fertilization does not occur
- Hybrid In-viability:
	- Hybrids do not survive
	- Less successful than the parents
- Hybrid Infertility:
	- Hybrids are infertile
