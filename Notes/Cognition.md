**Heritability**:
A statistic used in genetics that estimates how much variation in a phenotypic trait in a population is due to genetics.

### Thinking

Defined as mental activity that goes on in the brain when a person is processing information.

Two forms of thinking: System 1 and system 2.

**System 1:**
Involves quick decisions and cognitive shortcuts
Guided by innate abilities and experiences

**System 2**:
Slower
Analytical and rule based
Dependent on formal education

### Mental Imagery

Are able to view images in our head.
The larger the image, the longer it takes to process it.
Can rotate and manipulate images.

*Spacial cognition* allows us to navigate our surroundings.

### Concepts and Prototypes

Concepts are ideas that represent a class of objects
CS Abstractions
Natural concepts are the result of experiences of concepts in real world.
Formal concepts are well defined.

### Problem-Solving and Decision-Making

Problem solving occurs when a goal must be reached by thinking.

**Trial and Error**:
Mechanical solution.
Simply try one solution after another until one works.

**Algorithms**:
Step by step procedures for solving problems. 

**Heuristics**:
A simple guiding rule or principle that applies to many situations. 
An educated guess based on prior experiences. 
Gain speed but lose accuracy

**Representativeness Heuristic**:
Groups together objects with similar characteristics, assuming they are the same. 

**Availability Heuristic**:
Based on our estimation of the frequency of an event based on how easy it is to recal information.
Terrorism reporting vs. terrorism experience.

**Working Backward Heuristic**:
Work backward from the goal. 

**Subgoals**:
Better to break larger goals in to smaller subgoals. 

**Insight**:
When a solution to a problem comes suddenly to mind.

### Problems with Problem-Solving

**Functional Fixedness**:
Thinking only about objects in their typical uses.

**Mental Sets**:
Persist in using patterns that have worked in the past. 

**Confirmation Bias**:
Search for evidence that fits one's beliefs, ignoring anything contrary. 

---

### Creativity

Solving problems by combining ideas or behavior in new ways. 

Convergent thinking: Every problem has one solution, all roads lead to Rome.

Divergent thinking is the opposite.
Divergent thinking tends to happen while preforming autonomic tasks.

### Theories of Intelligence

**Spearman's G Factor**:
Two different abilities:
- Ability to reason and solve problems (g factor)
- Task specific abilities in arts (s factor)

Those who did well in seemingly unrelated school subjects had a positive coorelation in other subjectgs

**Cattell-Horn-Carroll Theory**:
Intelligence is based on culmination of work from several theoriests. 
Knowledge and skills vs. Problem solving and adaptability
Crystalized intelligence vs. fluid intelligence.

**Neuroscience Theories**:
Frontal and parietal brains play the most important roles. 
Working memory

**Gardner's Multiple Intelligences**:
Nine intelligences:
- Verbal/linguistic
- Musical
- Logical/mathematical
- Visual/spatial
- Movement
- Interpersonal (Understanding motivation)
- Intrapersonal (Ability to understand one's emotions and how they guide actions)
- Naturalist (Recognize patterns found in nature)
- Extentialist (sees bigger picture)

**Sternberg's Triarchic Theory**:
Three kinds of intelligence
- Analytical intelligence
- Creative intelligence
- Practical intelligence

**Emotional Intelligence**:

### Measuring Intelligence

IQ test one of the most influential inventions in modern history, aside the atomic bomb.

A Good Test:
- Reliability (Same scores upon retake)
- Validity (Measures what it is supposed to measure)

**Binet's Mental Ability Test**:
Tested many normal children at each age. Obtained average for each age.
Fast learners give answers that older children gave, slower learners gave answers typical of younger child.
This determined the child's mental age.

Mental age key factor in intelligence.

However, the test did not apply to older persons, so they standardized age samples. 

**Stanford-Binet and IQ**:
Developed by Lewis Terman at Stanford University

$IQ=MA / {CA} * 100$

MA = Mental age
CA = Actual age
