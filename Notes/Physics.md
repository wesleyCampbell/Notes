Physics can be described as the science of:
- Motion--position, velocity, acceleration, vectors, etc.
- Interactions--Force, Newton's laws, contact forces, torque, work, momentum
- Energy

Everything is measured in units:
| Quantity     | Description          | Units      |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ---------- |
| mass         | mass                 | kg         |
| time         | time                 | s          |
| distance     | length               | m          |
| velocity     | length/time          | m/s        |
| acceleration | length/time^2        | m/s^2      |
| force        | mass * length/time^2 | kg * m/s^2 |
| pressure     | force / area         | kg/m/s^2   |
| density      | mass/length^3        | kg/m^3     |
| current      | current (ampere)     | A          |
