## Mendel's Experiments

#### Edible Pea:
- Self-fertilization:
	- Male stamen produce pollen (sperm) that fertilizes female egg in the *same* plant
- Cross-fertilization:
	- Male stamen of one plant fertilizes the female egg of a *different* plant
- True-Breeding:
	- Some trait that is inherited unchanged by all offspring of self-fertilization
	- For however many offspring the plant produces, the trait is constant throughout them
	- Homozygous Alleles

#### The Experiments
- White flower self-fertilization:
	- Offspring all white flowers
- Purple flower self-fertilization:
	- Offspring all purple flower
- **True-Breeder Purple X True-Breeder White**:
	- All offspring $F_1$ are purple flowers
	- Purple is dominant over white
- **$F_1$ Offspring**:
	- 3 out of 4 $F_2$ offspring are purple
	- 1 out of 4 $F_2$ offspring are white

#### Dominant Traits vs. Recessive Traits:
- Trait is determined by pairs of genes, one from each parent (one allele from each parent)
- One dominant allele (A) and one recessive (a)
- "A" may mask "a", but "a" is still there
- In pea, purple (P) is dominant to white (p)

## Mendel's Laws

#### Law of Segregation:
- Pairs of alleles on homologous chromosomes separate during meiosis
- Each gamete (sperm or egg) only gets one allele by chance

#### Law of Independent Assortment
Genes (alleles) are inherited independently of each other.
- Only true if the genes of those traits are on different pairs of homologous chromosomes
- If genes are on the same chromosome, most likely inherited together
- Linked together

## Punnett Squares

Came up with a way to predict the expressed trait.

###### Single Gene Single Alele

Cross a Purple Parent (PP homozygous dominant) with a White Parent (pp homozygous recessive)

| -   | P   | P   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| p   | Pp  | Pp  |
| p   | Pp  | Pp  |

Probability of that crossing producing purple offspring is 100%.
Probability of that crossing producing white offspring is 0%.


###### Multiple Genes Multiple Alleles

Seed color and seed shape:
- Smooth is dominant to wrinkled (Ss)
- Yellow is dominant to green (Yy)

With a true-breed smooth, yellow:
- SSYY
crossed with a true-breed wrinkled, green:
- ssyy

To cross multiple genes and alleles, you have to take all combinations of the two alleles crossed with every other combination of alleles for the second set

| -   | SY   | SY   | SY   | SY   |
| --- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| sy  | SsYy | SsYy | SsYy | SsYy |
| sy  | SsYy | SsYy | SsYy | SsYy |
| sy  | SsYy | SsYy | SsYy | SsYy |
| sy  | SsYy | SsYy | SsYy | SsYy |

Phenotype is the expressed trait, while the genotype are the actual alleles or the genetic make up.

## Modes of Inheritance:

###### Complete Dominance:
- The dominant allele completely overrides the recessive allele

###### Incomplete Dominance
- A heterozygotic gene phenotype is an intermediate state between the dominant and recessive phenotypes
- Example of Snapdragons:
	- Red flower (RR) crossed with white flower (rr)
	- Result is a pink flower (Rr)

###### Co-Dominance
- A heterozygotic gene phenotype is both the dominant and recessive phenotypes mixed together
- Example of Dogs:
	- White dog (WW) crossed with a black dog (ww)
	- Result is a white dog with black spots (Ww)

###### Sex-Linked 
- The gene is on one of the sex chromosomes
- Most likely the X chromosome
- When a gene on the X chromosome is recessive, males will display it while females won't unless both their X chromosomes have the recessive gene

###### Linked Genes
- Genes are located on the same chromosome and are inherited together

## Single Gene with Multiple Alleles

It is possible for a gene to have more than one allele possibility. 

Human blood type
Type A: AA or AO, type A glycoprotein
Type B: BB or BO, type B glycoprotein
Type AB: AB, A and B glycoprotein
Type O: OO, no glycoprotein

## Genetic Disorders

###### Dominant Disorders:
- Heterozygotes are carriers to the next generation and have the condition & homozygotes have the condition commonly in more severe form
- Heterozygotes have it, but less severe than homozygote dominants
- Examples:
	- Huntington's disease
	- Polydactyly
	- Variegate Porphyria: inability to synthesize hemoglobin

###### Recessive Disorders:
- Heterozygotes are carriers but do not have the condition
- Examples:
	- Albinism
	- Sickle-Cell Anemia

###### Sex-Linked Conditions
- Gene is carried on the sex chromosomes
- Much more likely to be on the X than the Y
- Examples:
	- Hemophilia
	- Red/green color blindness
	- Patterned baldness
