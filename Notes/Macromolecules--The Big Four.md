## Carbon

Everything that is alive has carbon in it.

Carbon is capable of bonding 4 times to something else:
- Forms long chain-like backbone or hexagonal-type ring

**Carbon Functional Groups**:
- Bonds to the carbon backbones, participates in chemical reactions such as dehydration synthesis and hydrolysis
- Monomer:
	- Single subunits
- Polymer:
	- Long chains of monomers
- Highly unstable and highly reactive
- Highly attractive to organic molecules
- Functionality of macromolecules depends on the orientation of these functional groups

## Chemical Reactions

###### Dehydration Synthesis:
- Takes out a water molecule from a molecule
- Organic molecules joined (synthesized) by removing water
- In solution

**Hydrolysis**:
- Organic molecules broken (lyse) by adding water
- In solution

## Carbohydrates

#### Sugars

Comprised mostly of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen
1 carbon to 2 hydrogen to 1 oxygen
1:2:1

Can be simple (glucose) and they can be complex (starch).

Used for energy storage and structure.

###### Monosaccharide:
- One sugar molecule
- Glucose
- Fructose (fruits and veggies)
- Galactose (Dairy products)
- Ribose (Ribosomes)
- Maltose (alcohol)

###### Polysaccharide:
- Many sugar molecules bonded together
- Starch in plants
- Glycogen in animals
- Cellulose in plant structure; non-digestible in humans (fiber)
- Chitin in the exoskeleton of arthropods

#### Lipids

Comprised of mostly carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen
Long carbon chains

Hydrophobic; insoluble in water.

Store energy, have waxy covering, membranes.

**Monomer**:
- Fatty Acids

Hydrophobic tails (don't dissolve in water) and hydrophilic heads.
Phospholipids!!

###### Fats:
- More energy storage than sugars, but weigh less
- Saturated Fat:
	- Maximum number of single hydrogen bonds
	- Full of hydrogen, rigid.
	- Solid at room temp
- Unsaturated Fat:
	- Some double bonds
	- Oils
	- Not full of hydrogen, not rigid/kinky
	- Liquid at room temp

###### Phospholipids
- Hydrophobic "tails" and hydrophilic "heads" (cell membranes)
- Steroids
- Cholesterol: good (HDL) and bad (LDL)
- Hormones (estrogen vs. testosterone)
	- One hydroxyl substituted for ketone
	- Addition of a methyl
	- Not much of a chemical difference

Function:
- Energy storage (more than carbs)
- Membranes

## Proteins

Comprised of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen

The building blocks of Proteins are amino acids
- Monomer of amino acid
- Only 20 naturally occurring amino acids

Polymer:
- Polypeptides

Denaturation:
- Chemically or thermally breaking protein bonds
- Can be denatured at high temps (thermal burns) or extreme pH (chemical burns)

###### Protein Structure
- Primary Structure:
	- The order of the amino acids
	- 1D
- Secondary Structure:
	- Folding, bending, or pleating
	- Done through hydrogen bonding
	- 2D shapes (kinda. More used for memorizational purposes)
- Tertiary Structure:
	- Hydrogen and disulfide bonds
	- Fold in on themselves 
	- 3D shapes
- Quaternary Structure:
	- Globular = Hemoglobin
	- Strands = Collagen
	- Multiple tertiary structures bonded together

## Nucleotides/Nucleic Acids

Comprised of mostly carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus

Monomer:
- Nucleotide
- Nucleotide is the building block of nucleic acid

Polymer: 
- DNA
- RNA

ATP = adenosine triphosphate it a nucleotide. ATP is the fuel that makes you go.

DNA and RNA are nucleic acids
- Different sugar groups + nucleotides
- Same nitrogenous bases

###### DNA
- Deoxyribonucleic acid
- Nucleotides:
	- Guanine (G)
	- Adenine (A)
	- Cytosine (C)
	- Thymine (T)
	- G and C always bond together
	- A and T always bond together 

###### RNA
- Ribonucleic acid
- Nucleotides:
	- Guanine (G)
	- Adenine (A)
	- Cytosine (C)
	- Uracil (U)
	- G and C always bond together
	- A and U always bond together
