An object's momentum is defined as its mass times it's [[Position, Displacement, and Average Velocity|velocity]].
As velocity is a vector, momentum is as well. 

The symbol associated with momentum is $\vec p$.

Unless acted on by an outside [[Newton's Laws|force]], the momentum of a system will always be conserved, thus:
$$\vec p_0 = \vec p_1$$
for all time.

### Elastic Collisions

A collision where two objects bounce off of each other and travel at different velocities.

In elastic collisions, [[Kinetic Energy]] will be conserved.

---

### Inelastic Collisions

A collision where two objects collide and stick together.

Note that in inelastic collisions, [[Kinetic Energy]] will **not** be conserved.

### Impulse

Impulse is a change in momentum symbolized by $\Delta \vec p$ and can be calculated by:
$$
\Delta \vec p = \int \vec Fdt = \vec p_1 - \vec p_0
$$

Or if the force is constant, it can be simplified to:
$$
\Delta \vec p = \vec F \cdot \Delta t = \vec p_1 - \vec p_0
$$
