### Geography

The China region is fairly isolated with mountains to the south, deserts to the north and west, and the ocean to the east. 
This limited the outside interaction to central China, and as such they were able to develop unprecedented cultural cohesion and political unification.

There are areas with annual monsoon seasons, allowing for good agricultural processes. 

The Yellow river provided plenty of nutrients to the soil. As it sometimes floods over, devastating fields, it is known as "China's sorrow". 
This is excellent for rice cultivation.

### Culture of Ancient China
