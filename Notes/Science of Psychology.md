The study of mental processes and behavior

## Early Pioneers of Psychology

#### Structuralism
- **Wilhelm Wundt**: the first person to apply scientific principles to the study of the human mind. To inspect mind's different elements, his students had to objectively study their own thoughts: a process called *objective introspection*. He is known as the **father of psychology**. 
- **Edward Titchener**: a student of Wundt, he expanded upon his ideas. Rather than asking students to simply describe physical sensations, he utilized objective introspection for thoughts. *Margaret F. Washburn*, one of Titchener's students was the first woman to receive a Ph.D. in psychology. She wrote the book *The Animal Mind*.

#### Functionalism
- **William James**: a professor at Harvard, James studied on how the mind allows people to function in real life. This viewpoint was called *Functionalism*. He thought that behavioral traits could provide advantages just as physical traits could as well.

Many of these viewpoints are no longer major perspectives in modern psychology, but helped inspire modern psychological theory. 

#### Gestalt Psychology
- **Max Wertheimer**: believed that the "whole is greater than the sum of its parts." He studied sensation which resulted in *Gestalt psychology*. ***Gestalt psychology*** is now a part of *cognitive psychology*. 

#### Psychoanalysis
- **Sigmund Freud**: Freud proposed that we have an unconscious mind that we repress our threatening urges and desires into. He proposed that early childhood experiences were significant to us. He had a technique of ***psychoanalysis***, which led to modern *psychotherapy*. 

#### Behaviorism
- **Ivan Pavlov**: showed that a reflex could be caused by a stimulus that was before unrelated. He had the experiment with the salivating dogs.
- **John B. Watson:** Watson took Pavlov's findings and founded ***behaviorism***. He thought that we should study only *observable behavior*. While Freud believed that all behavior stemmed from the unconscious mind, Watson believed that all behavior was *learned*. He had the experiment with "Little Albert" who became scared of all fuzzy things. A student of his, *Mary Cover Jones* later proved that counterconditioning was possible.
- **B.F. Skinner**:
	- Operant conditioning. 

#### Cognitive:
- **Piaget**

#### Sociocultural
- **Vygotsky**: focused on the sociocultural relationships that caused behavior

#### Biopsychological

#### Evolutionary
- **Darwin**

#### Humanism
- **Maslow and Rogers**

## Modern Psychology

The seven modern perspectives:
- **Behavioral**: Behavior results from learning and experience
- **Cognitive**: Behavior results from how you think. It focuses on how people think, store, and remember information. 
- **Psychodynamic**:  Behavior results from influence from the unconscious mind and childhood experiences
- **Humanistic**: People are able to direct their own lives, choose their own destiny, and strive for self-actualization. 
- **Sociocultural**: Behavior results from the people and culture around them. How does being in a group affect your behavior? When you're alone?
- **Biopsychological**: Behavior results from events occurring in the body. 
- **Evolutionary**: Behavior results from biology 

The types of phycological professionals:
- Psychologist: has no medical training, but had a Ph.D. Are specialized. 
- Psychiatrist: has a medical degree; specializes in diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders. 

> Basic Research -- research for the sake of gaining scientific knowledge

> Applied Research -- Used for selling products. Typically for marketing. 

> Clinical Research -- Medically based; trial and placebo comparison. Typically for medication. 


**Types of Professions:**
- Lay Psychologists
	- Everyday people who use the principles of psychology
- Clinical Psychologists:
	- No medical training, but has a doctorate. Specialized.
- Psychiatrist:
	- Has a medical degree and is a physician who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment

## Critical Thinking

Making logical, reasoned judgements. Almost all "truths" need to be proven. Evidence needs to be carefully gathered so there is no bias. 

Ethos is not a good enough argument by itself. 

There are four goals of psychology:
1. Description
	-  What is happening?
2. Explanation
	-  Why is it happening
	-  Theory
3. Prediction -- is it lawful?
	-  Will it happen again
4. Control
	-  How can it be changed

## The Scientific Approach

[[Notes/The Scientific Method]]

### The Descriptive Methods (Studies)

- **Naturalistic Observation:** Observe subjects in their *natural* environment. 
	- Advantages:
	  - Natural, not artificial, behavior. 
  - Disadvantages:
	  - *Observer bias*. One way to counter this is with blind observers.
	  - Each setting is unique. There is no way to prove the setting has an effect on the response variables.
	  - It's a study. You are not able to prove cause and effect with an observational study.
- **Laboratory Observation**: 
	- Advantages:
		- More convenient for equipment setup
		- You have **control** over everything
	- Disadvantages:
		- An artificial situation might result in artificial behavior. 
- **Case Studies**: Studying an individual in great detail.
	- Advantages:
		- Provides a very large amount of detail. *Phineas Gage* was a subject in a case study.
		- Able to study things that would be unmoral to make a experiment on.
	- Disadvantages:
		- Cannot apply the findings to others
		- Too many confounding variables at play
- **Surveys:** 
	- Advantages:
		- Allows us to gain data about things too personal to study
		- Can get a large amount of data on a subject
	- Disadvantages:
		- Response bias or courtesy bias.
		- Need to be careful about leading questions. 


### Forms of Biases
- Observer Bias:
	- The tendency of observers to see what they expect to see
- Sample Bias:
	- Deals with sample population
- Response Bias:
	- Surveys; respondents can be biased

### Finding Correlation

Standard statistical definition of the correlation coefficient.

It bears repeating that *Correlation does not prove causation*, only that two variables are related.

How do we establish causation?

### The Experiment

The only way to prove causation is through an experiment.
The importance of randomization *cannot* be overstated. The three critical factors in a legitimate experiment are *randomization*, *repetition*, and *control*


The steps:
1. Collect a random sample from the population of interest.
2. Identify the explanatory (independent) and response(independent) variables
3. Make your study groups. One *must* be a control group while the others are experimental groups

It is important to not allow bias of any kind influence the experiment. From the observer to 
the subject, bias needs to be control. This implies the usage of *double-blind* experiments. 

The ethics of performing experiments are critical to follow. The people come first, not the study. 
- You are also now required to inform the participants about the study so they might make an informed decision.
- Any deception must be justified and the patients involved must be informed afterwards.
- Any participant may withdraw at any time.
- Any risk must be disclosed to the participants, or they must be protected from all risk
- You must debrief patients
- All data is confidential
- If a participant reacts negatively to the treatments, the researcher must detect, remove, or correct the consequences

Studying animals makes studying long-term effects much easier.
It also removes many moral reasons that had halted research prior. There are still moral guidelines, but they are not as encompassing.
