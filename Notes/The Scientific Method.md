Reduces bias and error

1. **Perceive the Question:** Notice something that we do not understand.
2. **Form a Hypothesis:** Form an educated guess that you can test.
3. **Test the Hypothesis:** Test your hypothesis, but be wary of *confirmation bias*.
4. **Draw Conclusions:** Look at the evidence. The hypothesis will either be supported, or it will not be.
5. **Report the Results:** Report your conclusion in such a fashion that others can replicate your experiment. Your results could help others, or others could help you with your experimental design. Communication is *key* in the scientific world. 

**Scientific Method**:
1. Observation
2. Question
3. Hypothesis
	- Inductive reasoning: 
		- Many individual facts that lead to a general conclusion
		- Method of discovery
	- Deductive Reasoning
		- If this, then that; general to specific
		- Method of verification
4. Experiment
	- One prediction at at time
	- One variable at a time
	- Control groups
	- Quantitative rather than qualitative 
	- Large sample size
5. Conclusion
	- Repeatable
	- Peer review
	- Communication
	- Falsification
