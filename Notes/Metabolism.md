[[Thermodynamic Laws]]


###### Energy Flow through a system
- Chemical RXN:
	- Builds or breaks bonds:
	- Reactants --> Products
	- Exergonic gives up energy (heat)
	- Endergonic requires energy input

## Energy Flow

### Building Energy/ATP

###### Formula
- C6H12O6 + 6O2 --> Energy + 6CO2 + 6H2O
- 1 Glucose + 6 oxygen --> Energy + 6 carbon dioxide + 6 water
- Produces thermal energy + ATP

### Transferring Energy

###### Activation Energy/Moving Energy Around
- Electron carriers
- ATP: the most common energy-carrier molecule
	- Comes from glucose breakdown
	- Highly unstable
	- ATP can only be used within the cell, but can't be transferred from cell to cell

###### Coupled Reactions
- Very common in cells
- Exergonic reactions provide energy for the endergonic reactions
	- ATP from glucose breakdown "fires" protein synthesis in the endergonic reactions
	- Exergonic and endergonic reactions occur in different places
	- Needs a carrier like ATP or electrons 
	- Relatively slow

###### Catalysts and Enzymes
- Biological catalysts are enzymes
	- Lowers the activation energy of reactions
	- Speeds up exergonic and endergonic reactions
	- Not used up; they are recycled
- Catalysts speed up the reaction 
- All enzymes are catalysts, but not all catalysts are enzymes
- Enzymes end in "ace"

## Enzymes

Enzymes are proteins:
- Comprised of the amino acid monomers
- Can be denatured

###### Lock and Key Scenario:
- Enzymes are a very specific shape
- Some only act when there is a coenzyme (some require a partner in crime)
- Substrate contacts active site of the enzyme (substrate hooks into the active site)
- Change in the shape causes a reaction
- Substrate leaves enzyme

###### Gradual energy transfer:
- Baby steps:
	- Many small reactions with many enzymes
	- The substrate goes from enzyme to enzyme until final product reached
- Enzymes do one small reaction
- There is a gradual energy transfer

###### Enzyme Production
- To increase the reaction speed:
	- Increase enzymes:
		- Increase enzyme synthesis
		- Inactive forms will activate when food is consumed
	- Increase the substrate

###### Enzyme Regulation
- Enzyme regulation occurs in the cells
- Ways for the cell to inhibit enzyme activity:
	- Competitive Inhibitor:
		- Molecule blocks the active site
		- The enzyme wont work and the reaction can't continue
		- TB, bacterium and vaccine, toxin of Parkinson's
		- Competes with the substrate over the active site
	- Non-Competitive Inhibitor:
		- Some other molecule binds to the enzyme and distorts it
		- Doesn't compete for the active site
		- Active site is still open, but it is the wrong shape and the reaction cannot continue
	- Feedback Inhibition:
		- Large amounts of ATP can block the production of more ATP
		- After a long chain of enzyme-substrate reactions, a substrate that can act as an non-competitive inhibitor for one of first enzymes in the chain
