###### Examples of Community Interactions
- Competition: lose, lose
- Predation: lose, win
- Parasitism: lose, win
- Mutualism: win, win

###### Ecological Niche:
- Everything a species does or encounters in a habitat
- What it eats, nutrients
- Physical Residence
- Conditions of physical residence
- Reproductive activities
	- Partner
	- Seasons
- etc.

---

#### Competition

###### Competition
- Competition is the greatest with greater niche overlap
	- One species can outcompete the other to extinction
	- Competitive exclusion

###### Resource Partitioning:
- Reduce competition by partitioning out or using different parts of a resource
- Adapt to reduce overlap and exclusion
- If competition is not avoided
- Both populations are restricted

---

#### Predator/Prey

###### Predators:
- Organisms that consume other animals

Predators and prey can act as selection pressures on each other
Develops adaptions in response to the other

Countermeasures: A war of attrition

###### Camouflage
- On both sides
- Harder to see, harder to kill or harder to prevent

###### Prevention
- Bright colors -- DANGER
- Mimicry:
	- Looking/behaving like something else
	- Look like a poisonous species
- Startle Coloration:
	- Look like something much bigger
- Aggressive Mimicry:
	- Some method of attracting prey to their doom
- Chemical Warfare:
	- Release chemicals to prevent consumption

---

#### Parasitism

Parasites and hosts can be selective agents on each other

---

#### Mutualism

Two species do better together than apart
Adapt to interact

## Community Evolution

Succession: Structural change over time

Starts with an initial disturbance.

#### Succession Types:
- Primary:
	- From Scratch
	- No evidence of any or previous community
	- Completely wiped out
	- E.g. Paving roads
- Secondary Sucession:
	- Still major disturbance
	- Some elements left behind
	- E.g. Fire

Pioneer species appear first
Climax community eventually results
