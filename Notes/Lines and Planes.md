## Lines 

#### Standard Form of a Line

The standard form of a line in $\Bbb R^2$ can be found with:
$$
ax + by = c
$$
Where $a$, $b, c$ are any value in $\Bbb R$

#### Normal Form of a Line

Given a normal vector $\vec n$ , x vector $\vec x$ , and a point on the line $\vec p$, the vector form of a line in $\Bbb R^2$ is given by:
$$
\vec n\cdot\vec x = \vec n\cdot\vec p
$$
The normal vector $\vec n$ can be found taking the constants $a, b$  from the standard from of the line:
$$
\vec n = \left [\begin{matrix} a \\ b \end{matrix}\right ]
$$

#### Vector Form of a Line

The vector form of a line in $\Bbb R^n$ can be found with a point on the line $\vec p$ and a direction vector $\vec u$ that points in the direction of the line and is equal to:
$$
\vec x = \vec p + t\vec u
$$
where t is any value in $\Bbb R$ .

## Planes

#### Standard Form of a Plane

The standard form of a plane in $\Bbb R^3$ can be found by the following equation:
$$
ax + by + cz = d
$$
where $a, b, c, d$  are all any values in $\Bbb R$. 

---

#### Normal Form of a Plane

The normal form of a plane in $\Bbb R^3$ is the exact same as the normal form of a line:
$$
\vec n\cdot\vec x = \vec n\cdot\vec p
$$
where $\vec n$ is the normal vector and $\vec p$ is a point on the plane

---

#### Vector Form of a Plane

The vector form of a plane in $\Bbb R^3$ can be found with the following equation:
$$
\vec x = \vec p + t\vec u + s\vec v
$$
where $\vec p$ is a point on the plane, $\vec u$ and $\vec v$ are direction vectors, and $t$ and $s$ are parameters.
