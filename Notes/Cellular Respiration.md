Staying alive costs a TON of ATP:
- Used in DNA replication
- Active Transport
- Moving
- Growth and reproduction

## The Making of ATP
- [[Metabolism]]
- ATP is highly reactive and unstable
- 1 molecule of glucose the cell will make:
	- 38 molecules of ATP in prokaryotes
	- 36-38 molecules of ATP in eukaryotes
- Hydrolysis (breaking using water) of ATP is exergonic (release of energy) = ATP
- ATP + H2O --> ADP + P + energy
- So how does the cell regenerate more ATP
	- Cell Respiration

## Process of Cellular Respiration

### Glycolysis
- Occurs outside of the mitochondria 
- A molecule of glucose is split
- Produces 2 ATP

---

### Kreb's Cycle
- Occurs inside the mitochondria
- Loads up the electron carriers used in the ETC
- Produces 2 ATP and $CO_2$

---

### Electron Transport Chain
- Occurs inside the mitochondria
- Requires oxygen
- Pumps H+ ions to create a concentration gradient
- The ions flow down the gradient through ATP synthase which makes ATP
- Produces 32-34 ATP and $H_2O$
