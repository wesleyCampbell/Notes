Muslims were believers in the prophets and those submissive to God's will.

Dome of the Rock:
Represents the departing point of Muhammad's Night Journey.

Worship of the one true God (Allah)
The Quran finished in the 800s

All was to unite under the Arab empire.  

**Muhammad**:
Muhammad was born in 571:
- His tribe was in charge of the Kaaba
	- Founded by Abraham and Ishmael around a black corner stone representing God's covenant with Abraham and Ishmael
	- It was pagan during the time Muhammad
While Muhammad was meditating, Gabriel visited him to give God's law
- Preserved in the Quran
He was rejected by his tribe and fled to Medina

**Five Duties of Islam*::
- Profession of faith
- Prayer
- Fasting
- Alms-Giving (tithing)
- Pilgrimage to Mecca and the Kaaba

**Islamic Law**:
Sharia: Many different interpretations

**After Muhammad**:
Succession crisis.
- Majority (Sunnis) believed father-in-law should reign as *caliph*
- Minority (Shia or Shiites) believed cousin and son-in-law should rule

Various rulers under the four main caliphates during medieval period.
- Caliphate was the head of the Islamic community (priest king)
- Rashidun, Umayyad, Abbasid, Ottoman
