###### Autotrophs:
- Produce their own food suply
- Producers
- Photosynthesizers

###### Heterotrophs:
- Primary: 
	- Herbivores
- Secondary
	- Carnivores that consume primary

###### Detrius Feeders:
- Feed on waste and the dead
- Can be producers, consumers, primary or secondary heterotrophs

###### Decomposers:
- Secrete enzymes outside then absorb nutrients
- Mostly fungi and bacteria

The more diversity are in higher productive areas

###### Food Chains
- Linear, not very informative

###### Food Web
- Looks like a graph
- Interconnecting food chains
- Allows for omnivores: "all eaters"
- More complicated
