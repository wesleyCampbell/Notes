The following relates to [[Matrixes#Matrix Inverses|invertible matrices.]]

Let $A$ be a square $n\times n$ matrix. All the following statements are either all **true** or all **false**:
1. $A$ is [[Matrixes#Matrix Inverses|invertible]]
2. $A\space\vec x=\vec b$ has a unique solution for every $\vec b$ in $\Bbb R^n$
3. $A\space\vec x=\vec0$ has only the trivial solution
4. The [[Row Reduction#Reduced Row Echelon Form|Reduced Row Echelon Form]] of $A$ is the identity matrix
5. $A$ is a product of [[Matrixes#Elementary Matrices|elementary matrices]]
6. The columns and rows of $A$ are [[Spanning Sets and Linear Independence#Linear Independence|linearly independant]] from each other
7. The columns of $A$ [[Spanning Sets and Linear Independence#Spans of Vectors Sets|span]] $\Bbb R^n$
8. $Rank(A) = n$
9. $Nullity(A) = 0$
10. The rows or columns of A are a basis for $\Bbb R^n$
