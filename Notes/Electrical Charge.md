## Charge and Transference

**Electrical Charge**:
- Neutral matter has an equal amount of positive and negative charge
- Negative charge comes from electrons
- Positive charge has more positive than negative
- Negative charge has more negative than positive
- Charge can be transferred between objects through contact
- Electrical charge is measured in Coulombs (C)
	- $1 C = 6.24 \times 10^{18}$ electrons

**Transference of Charge**:
- Any two dissimilar materials can become charged when brought into contact with each other; this is caused by friction or when they are separated rapidly, breaking the electron bonds.
- No charge is created; electrons are simply transferred
- This is called **Charging by Conduction**

**Conductors and Insulators**:
- Ions in solid form are immovable: insulator
- Ions in liquid form are able to move around, thus they become an conductor
- Solids where the electron is locked to the atom (as in diamonds or glass) are insulators
- Metallic solids, the electrons are able to move around, making it a conductor

## Polarization

Objects that, as a whole, are neutral can become *polarized* when in close proximity to a charged object.
The particles of the object that are attracted to the charge end up closer to the charged object while the particles that are repelled end up further away.

In the example above, the rod is negatively charged. Even though the rod is not in contact with the electroscope, the electrons in the electroscope rearrange themselves according to the charge: the electrons want to be further away from the negatively charged rod. 

Polarization is the reason why neutral objects are slightly attracted to charged objects.

**Conductors vs Insulators:
- In conductors, the elecrons are free to move around, and as such can become polarized very easily
- In insulators, there electrons are not free to move around, and as such become only slightly polarized due to the electron cloud shifting a little. 

**Charging by Induction**:
It is possible for a neutral object that is polarized to become charged by simply touching it. The electrons will try to get as far away as possible from a negative charge, and as a result, will flow into you. When you remove the contact, the sphere is left with a positive charge.
