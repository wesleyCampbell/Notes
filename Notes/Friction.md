Friction is a force that is created when two objects rub against each other.

Friction will always be antiparallel of the velocity.

The amount of friction an object will experience is defined by the coefficient of friction $\mu$ between the two surfaces.
There are two forms of friction: **kinetic friction** and **static friction.**

Kinetic friction is the friction of motion:
While the object is moving it will experience kinetic friction.
Its coefficient of friction is $\mu_k$

---

Static friction is the friction the object experiences while at rest.
Its coefficient of friction is $\mu_s$.

---

The force of friction is equal to $\mu$ times the normal force, $F_n$:
$$f=\mu\cdot F_n$$

When an object begins to experience a force, it must surpass $F_n\mu_s$ before it begins to move.

After it begins to move, the force necessary to maintain motion is $F_n\mu_k$.

Note that $\mu_s > \mu_k$, thus the force necessary to begin motion is less than the force needed to maintain motion.
