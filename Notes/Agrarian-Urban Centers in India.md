### Geography

The region of India is very cut off from the rest of Eurasia. Surrounded by ocean on three sides and mountains on the fourth. 

The Indus river is slow with reliable overflows: better than the Tigris and Euphrates. It is very predictable. 
The agricultural system is influenced by annual monsoons and by the flooding of the Indus river. 


### Mehrgarh Culture (6000BC)

Raised wheat, barley, domesticated animals; had mud and brick structures.
Were semi-sedentary: every 10 years or so they would pick up and leave.
The oldest Neolithic site known in India; was a possible precursor to the Harappans.

### The Harappans (3000BC -1500BC)

Disappeared long ago.
Had an empire four times as large as Sargon the Great; two times larger than the Old Kingdom of Egypt. 
We know very little about this civilization, however. They disappeared from the historical record thousands of years ago. 

**The Region and People**:

Because of the flooding of the Indus River, cities were built on large artificial hills.
The two main cities, Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro are remarkably similar in design. The cities both had drains, uniform gridded streets, and similar layouts in buildings. 

There could possibly have been a kingdom, but we aren't sure if there were any social hierarchies; however, the bricks being uniform in size indicate that there was some authority calling the shots.

Evidence of an Authority:
- Cities were well planned on a grid
- Impressive uniformity
- Developed weights and measures
- Advanced sanitation system

They had a very complex trade system with their merchandise being found as far as Egypt.
*Lothal* was a city that specialized in exporting beads for jewelry and was the primary Harappan seaport. 

The main cities:
- Harappa (40k population)
- Mohenjo-Daro
- Lothal

Around 1500 BC the cities were abandoned for unknown reasons. Because we have found no weapons, it is possible they were wiped out. 

**Religion**:
- Swastikas 
- Fertility religion
- No evidence for temples or palaces

### The Indo-Europeans

Migrated into and interacted with the peoples of Europe, India, and Southwest Asia
It is still believed that Indo-European migrants, the *Vedas*, played a prominent role in the development of India.

This people were responsible for spreading many bronze and iron age technologies. (Ironworking and chariots being among them). They were excellent horsemen and weaponsmiths.

Where half of the world's languages came from.
The term Caucasian comes from "in the region of the Caucasus Mountains"

Started the Vedic period

### Interactions in Northern India--The Vedic Period (1500BC-600BC)

Horses and Chariots used in warfare
Cattle were used for wealth ("sacred cow")

**The Vedas**:
The Vedas (religious hymns and epics) are our primary looking glass into the culture of early India. They were oral until they were transcribed in writing in 600BC. Only the Brahmins (the "twice born") were able to access them, creating a religious exclusiveness. 

The *Upanishads* are commentary on the Vedas. Also the commentators.

**The Varnas**: 
From the Vedas, we can find the *Varnas*.
The *Varnas* were a caste system:
```mermaid

Brahman-Top-->Kshatriya;
Kshatriya-->Vaishya;
Vaishya-->Shudra-Bottom;
```
- Brahmins: Priests, the "twice born"
- Kshatriyas: Warriors
- Vaishyas: Merchants
- Shudras: Farmers and Laborers

Eventually, as society became more complex, subdivisions known as the *jati* was born.
The *Dalits*, the untouchables, are considered below the caste system.

The Vedas gave rise to Hinduism. 

**Statecraft and the Ideology of Power** 

Rice was crucial in allowing for cities to be settled again, ending the more nomadic and village like life of the *Vedas*. The rice culture rose, requiring tedious, meticulous labor and a strong social organization. After cities came the larger states and kingdoms. 

16 large states dominated the sub-continent. The four largest of these *mahajanapadas*, Avanti, Vatsa, Kosala, and Magadha, dominated. In their search for influence, the larger states began to absorb weaker neighbors and seek for power. Naturally, divine kings rose; although, some states preserved their councils and republics. 

Horse sacrifice, deemed the most sacred of sacrifices, became increasingly elaborate. 

The political situation became ever more tense between the states (*mahajanapadas*). Warfare became much more sophisticated.

The rulers wondered about the limitation of their rule and their purpose, resulting in the *Mahabharata*. The *Mahabharata* is a very long poem (world's longest) including stories of rulers, battles, and epics. In it we find much about the way rulers aught to operate. This tome defined stateship in India.

### Indian Society, Culture, and Religion--The Vedic Period (1500-600BC)

Moved further south (into modern day India) than the Harrapans. 

Dharma (duty in accordance with one's capabilities and requirements of one's place in society) drove much of Indian culture. The *smriti*, or tradition influenced it.

Attributes intrinsic to farming were "found" in commoners, and Attributes intrinsic to service were "found" in servants, etc. 

It was one's duty to fulfil their Dharma in hope of a better life in the rebirth. They believed that their actions in this life would determine in which caste they would be rebirthed into. *Karma-Samsara*. 
This idea was a diversion from the Vedas. 

The male householder was responsible for feeding everyone else in his home before himself.
The role of women is complex. The role of woman is to be housemaker, a role worthy of worship. They were seen as a threat to fulfilling one's Dharma, however. Women were considered to be sexy: a distraction from what was seen as important. 

**Cultural Interactions**

Priests continued to gain influence by monopolizing ceremonies.

*Asceticism*: Renouncement of the material world to purify one's self.

### Recap

The Harappans, a society with intricate, beautiful cities, seemingly abandoned them for unknown reasons. 

The next 1000 years were smaller nomadic and village dwelling life.

An intricate social caste system, the Dharma, rose up, leading to Buddhism. 

Unlike Mesopotamia and Egypt, no single empire ruled over all of India, **and** the cities thrived for less than 1k years.
