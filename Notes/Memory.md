Memory: an active system that receives information from the senses, puts that information into a usable form, organizes it, stores it, and retrieves it from that storage.


**The Three Processes of Memory**:

1. **Encoding**: 
	- Convert the sensory information into information the brain can actually use. E.g. analog data into binary.
2. **Storage**: 
	- Store the information for some period of time. The time is dependent upon which memory system is being used. 
3. **Retrieval**:
	- Getting the information out of storage to use it.

Although some stages take place sequentially, many happen concurrently.

**The Three Memory Models**:

1. **Information-Processing Model**:
	- Memory occurs in the three processes of memory
2. **Parallels Distributed Processing**:
	- Stages happen concurrently
3. **Levels-Of-Processing**/**Deeper Meaning**:
	- Different levels of processing power will be used depending on the purpose/meaning of the information

Each of these models has its purpose. 

**The Three Forms of Memory:**
1. Sensory
2. Short Term Memory (STM)
3. Long Term Memory (LTM)

### The Information-Processing Model
![[memory_diagram.jpg]]

**Sensory Memory**:
Information enters the nervous system as neural messages.

Two kinds of sensory memory: *iconic* (visual) and the *echoic* (auditory):
- **Iconic Memory**:
Doesn't last very long; it is replaced by new data quickly in a process called *masking*.
Helps the brain decide whether something is important enough to raise attention too.
- **Echoic Memory**:
Lasts longer than iconic memory, but can't store as much.

**Short-Term Memory & Working Memory**:
Can be held for 12-30 seconds or more.
*Selective Attention* is when our brain is only looking for a particular stimulus.

Working Memory is considered an active system within the short-term memory system that processes the information. It decides if information is important to keep.
It utilizes the frontal cortex.
It consists of:
- A central authority that controls and coordinates the other sub-systems
- A visual representation of the information
- An auditory representation of the information

It compares new information from the STM to the old information from the LTM.
The desk analogy: file cabinets represent long-term memory, and your desk represents your working memory. You can see the documents, read them, process them, etc.

**Long-Term Memory**:

A physical change in the brain. The memories may always be there, but you may not be able to reach them.


- *Maintenance Rehearsal*: Repeating information over and over again to remember it
- *Elaborative Rehearsal:* Increasing the number of stimuli for information by connecting it to something you already know very well

Types of long-term memory:
- **Nondeclarative/Implicit**:
	- Memory for skills. Uses separate areas of the brain than other forms of LTM
	- Stored in the cerebellum 
- **Declarative/Explicit**:
	- All of the facts and knowledge we possess. 
	- **Sematic Memory**:
		- General knowledge that anyone can know
	- **Episodic Memory**:
		- Personal knowledge such as memories. These tend to be updated *constantly*.


We remember emotional memories much more vividly.

Stress removes cells in the hippocampus, reducing its size.
This is a result of large amounts of cortisol being released in the brain.

### Memory Retrieval

Retrieval Cues: a stimulus that is associated with a piece of information. 
- **Context Effects**: 
	- If your physical surroundings are the same as when you learned a piece of information, you will be better able to recall it
- **State Dependent**: 
	- Much like physical context, if you are in the same mental state as when you formed the memory, you will be better able to recall it

There are two forms of retrieval:
- **Recall**:
	- Memories are recalled with no external cues.
- **Recognition**:
	- Taking in information and matching it to what is already in memory.

### Forgetting

Forgetting happens quickest just after learning.

Theories of Forgetfulness:
- **Encoding Error:** 
	- Data doesn't get past the sensory stage
- **Memory Trace Decay:** 
	- Neuron paths decay after a long time of non-use
- **Interference Theory**: 
	- Memories cannot be accessed due to other information interfering
		- **Proactive Interference**: 
			- Older information interfering with the learning and retrieval of new material
		- **Retroactive Interference**:
			- Newer information interferes with the retrieval of older information

### Amnesia:

**Anterograde Amnesia:**
- Can't remember anything new
- H.M. is an example of this
	- His short term memory never sent anything to long-term

**Retrograde Amnesia**:
- No memories backward
- The more *popular* form of amnesia. The drama
- Alcoholic blackouts
- Alzheimer's disease

### Biology

The more often neurons fire together, the stronger the synapse will be be: more NMDA receptors form on the neuron.

The more a neuron is stimulated, the more synapses are formed. 

Alcohol blocks the NMDA receptors.
