#### Conservation Biology:
- The science of understanding and conserving all biodiversity
- Many levels and includes non-biological disciplines
	- Genetics
	- Species
	- Ecosystems
	- Politics and laws

#### Why Care?
Inherent right to exist? 
Long term ecosystem servicers
Direct benefits:
	Plant sources for medicines
	Less than 1% of all plants species have been tested for medicinal compounds
	This 1% is source of 25% of total prescriptions
	Food
	Shelter
	Clothing
Indirect Benefits:
	Soil and agriculture
	Erosion/flood control
	Climate
	New sources of genes
	Recreation

#### Ecological Economics
- Putting a price tag on ecosystem services
- What is clean water filtered through a wetland worth?
- Data driven enterprise

#### Changes in BIodiversity
- Easy to measure loss, hard to measure effects
- Extinction has always happened, but at a low rate
	- Exceptions are mass extinction events
- We don't know how many total species there are
- Most knowledge about birds and mammals
-
