## The Basics

**Pitch**:
- A sound created by vibrations
- How high or low a sound is. Faster the vibration, the higher the pitch

**Notes**:
- A note is a specific pitch.
- The note A is 440hz

**Chord**:
- Several notes played at the same time
- Several different chords such as major, minor, dominant, etc

**Consonance/Dissonance**:
- Consonance is when music features notes that sound nice together, with no tention
- Dissonance is when music features notes that don't sound nice together; there is a tension

**Interval**:
- The distance between any two notes or pitches
- First, third, fifth, and octave are all extremely consonant
- Minor second, minor third, augmented fourth, minor sixth and the seventh interval are dissonant

**Scale**:
- A succession of whole and half step intervals that sound normal
- Three major scales: major, minor, and chromatic

**Melody**:
- A melody is any succession of notes

**Phrase**:
- A short melody that would feel natural to take a breath after

**Motive**:

### Rhythm

**Rhythm**:
- How music occurs within time

**Beat**:
- A regularly recurring pulse
- Musical time is measured in beats

**Measure/Bar**:
- A unit of musical time
- Indicated in music by vertical bar lines

**Meter**:
- A pattern of regularly recurring accented beats
- Duple Meter: 2/4, 2/8, 2/2
- Triple Meter: 3/4, 3/8, 3/16
- Quadruple Meter: common time
- Compound Meter: Can be seen as either duple or triple: 6/8
- Nonmetrical: No meter. Gregorian Chants, for example.
- Mixed Meter: When music shifts between meters
- Irregular Meter: An irregular number of beats per measure. 5/4, 7/4, etc.

### Texture

**Texture**:
- The means by which melody, harmony, and rhythm are combined

**Monophony**:
- The most basic texture
- A single melody
- No harmony

**Homophony**:
- Melody line is enhanced by other musical materials, usually chords

**Polyphony**:
- Two or more melodic lines that are equal in importance
- **Imitative Polyphony**:
	- One melody ends, then another begins, imitating the first line
- **Non-imitative Polyphony**:
	- Two or more contrasting melody lines occurring at the same time

### Organizations of Music

**Form**:
- The way a piece of music is laid out
- Music is divided into sections and labeled A, B, etc.
- AB form is when section A plays, then section B
- ABA form is A --> B --> A

**Movement**:
- A self-contained portion of music that is part of a larger work

**Score**:
- A printed piece of the music: comprehensive; it shows all parts
