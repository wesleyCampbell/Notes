## Functions of Membranes

###### Separates Inside from Outside
- Regulates materials into and out of cells:
	- Diffusion and active transport
- Has a dynamic fluid barrier

###### Monitors External Environment
- Monitors the acidity outside of the cell
- Acts accordingly 

###### Cell Communication
- Communicates the types of the cell

###### Structure
- Maintains the structure of the cell
- Chemical reactions

###### Protection
- Protection
- movement,
- secretion
- Some cells transport

## Structure of Membranes

###### Bilayer of Phospholipids 
- Not bonded together
- polar "head"
- 2 non-polar "tails"
	- Double bond makes it kink

---

### Membrane Proteins

###### Receptor Proteins:
- The end of the protein has a very specific shape
- Some molecule fits into the end of the protein
- Causes a response inside the cell
- Receives a molecule that *does not* cross the membrane but causes a reaction

###### Recognition Proteins:
- Cellular I.D. tags
- Distinguishes self from others

###### Enzymes:
- Proteins that help chemical reactions
- End with "ase"
- Saliva (amylase)

###### Attachment Proteins:
- Holds the cytoskeleton to the membrane
- Attaches cells together
- Compared to velcro

###### Transport Proteins:
- Most complicated protein
- Regulates movement of molecules across the membrane
- Channel Proteins:
	- Things that are the right size can pass through
	- Acts as a passive conduit (no ATP)
	- Passive Transport
- Carrier Proteins:
	- Lock and key with molecules
	- Change shape
	- Then release to the other side
	- Requires energy (ATP) to move
	- Active transport

## Movement of Particles

### Diffusion:
- From area of high concentration to area of low concentration
- Ways to increase the rate of diffusion:
	- Increase the concentration
	- Increase the temperature
	- Increase the pressure
- Continues to happen until equalization
- Requires no ATP to happen, just physics

###### Simple Diffusion:
- Very small
- Non polar
- Lipid soluble
- O2, CO2, alcohols, some vitamins, steroids, H2O.
- No use of proteins, it just happens spontaneously
- Squeezes through the phospholipids in the membrane

###### Facilitated Diffusion:
- Diffusion using proteins
	- Through a channel proteins
- Channel proteins help molecules cross the membrane
- Still down a gradient (from high concentration to low concentration)
- No ATP required, is free
- Works on very small molecules, ions, etc.

---

### Osmosis:
- Diffusion of H2O down a gradient
- Free--No ATP required
	- Tonicity is a comparative term
	- Isotonic: Equal concentration of water and solute
	- Hypotonic: Less solute (more water) than the other side of the membrane
	- Hypertonic: More solute (less water) than other side of the membrane

---

### Active Transport:
- Very small molecules and ions moving across a membrane
- Against a gradient -- "uphill"
- Requires ATP
- Example:
	- Na+/K+ pump

---

### Endocytosis:
- Endo--meaning into
- Pinocytosis:
	- "cell drinking"
	- by way of infolding and vesicles
	- The cell "eats" a given portion of fluid, taking in the nutrients
	- The membrane sinks into the cell and pinches together, forming a vesicle holding fluid
- Receptor-mediated:
	- Proteins along the membrane combine with specific molecules, then infold
	- Sinks in, pinching up and forms a vesicle with the molecules inside
- Phagocytosis:
	- "Cell eating"
	- membrane arms extend and engulf particles (white blood cells)
	- membrane extends and pinches together, forming a vesicle with the particle inside
- Requires ATP

---

### Exocytosis
- Exo--meaning out of
- Particles or large molecules
- Vesicles move things like waste, hormones, and neurotransmitters to the membrane and released
- Faster than simple diffusion
	- Ca++ into synaptic space between nerve cells
