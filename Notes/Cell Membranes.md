## Functions of Membranes

###### Separates Inside from Outside
- Regulates materials into and out of cells:
	- Diffusion and active transport
- Has a dynamic fluid barrier

###### Monitors External Environment
- Monitors the acidity outside of the cell
- Acts accordingly 

###### Cell Communication
- Communicates the types of the cell

###### Structure
- Maintains the structure of the cell
- Chemical reactions

###### Protection
- Protection
- movement,
- secretion
- Some cells transport
-

## Structure of Membranes

###### Bilayer of Phospholipids 
- Not bonded together
- polar "head"
- 2 non-polar "tails"
	- Double bond makes it kink

### Membrane Proteins

###### Receptor Proteins:
- The end of the protein has a very specific shape
- Some molecule fits into the end of the protein
- Causes a response inside the cell
- Receives a molecule that *does not* cross the membrane but causes a reaction
