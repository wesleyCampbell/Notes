We use reference frames that are not stationary but are in motion relative to Earth.

We use vectors to describe movement, as they have both direction and magnitude.

**The Kinematic Equations**:
- $v = v_0 + at$
- $x = x_0 + v_0 t + \frac12a_xt^2$
- $v_x^2 - v_{0_x}^2 = 2a_x(x - x_0)$


**Average Velocity**:
- $\bar{v}=\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$
