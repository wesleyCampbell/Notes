## Music 

#### Sonata Form
- Tends to be used in the first movement of a symphony or in the overture of an opera
- Totally independent from the baroque sonatas
- Could start with a slow introduction.
- The Exposition:
	- First theme (tonic key)
	- A bridge (tonic key --> new key)
	- Second theme (new key)
	- Finishes with the Cadence Theme (new key)
	- Might repeat the exposition
- The Development:
	- Starts with the material provided in the exposition and throws it together however they like
	- Tons of modulations: switches between the new and old keys
	- Retransition to take us back to the tonic
- Recapitulation (Same as the exposition but in the tonic key):
	- First theme (tonic key)
	- Bridge (the tonic key)
	- Second theme (tonic key)
	- Cadence theme (the tonic key)
		- Might extend the cadence with a coda
- An instrumental form

#### Rondo Form
- Very open to tampering with 
- Alternates an A section with any other section:
	- A B A C A B A D A E A G A Z, whatever

---

#### Concerto Genre
- Soloist + orchestra
- Expands upon the baroque definition:
- Concerto Grosso much less common
- Cadenzas still happening
- Concertos are limited to 3 movements (Sonata, whatever (slower), and Rondo)
- Movement One: Sonata:
	- Orchestra plays the entire exposition (no modulation) then the clarinet plays the exposition and then modulate to the development
---

#### Sonata Genre
- Similar to Baroque sonata
- Either piano solo or piano + orchestral orchestra
- Typically multi-movements, but not always

---

#### Chamber Music
- Piano quintet:
	- Piano + 4 strings
- All groups labeled with an instrument first have that instrument + a number of strings
- Wind quintet: 5 winds

---

#### Opera
- Castrati out of favor. 
- If they needed a male part, they would use a woman.
	- Called trouser parts.
- Ensemble Number:
	- Differs from Baroque Ensemble Number
	- Plot moves forward
	- Each person singing their own thoughts
	- Hybrid between ensemble number and aria
	-
