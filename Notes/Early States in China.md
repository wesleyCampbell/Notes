### Imperial Unification

Similar to India, Persia, and Rome, we expect to see some sort of monism in China.

At the end of the Zhou Dynasty, during the Warring States period, three schools of thought:
- Confucianism
- Legalism
- Daoism
Chaos inspired a move toward moral order.

### Confucianism:
**Confucius**:
Confucius was a itinerant teacher (advisor).

Human beings *want* to be ethical and for society to achieve can achieve a higher moral order.

Children should respect their parents.
Rulers should be kind to their children/subjects.
Rulers should set a good example for the rest of society.

Reciprocity: do unto others (the golden rule)

Following these principles helps you to be in tune with the *Dao*, or the universal order. The way.

**Mencius**:
Later student of Confucianism.

People are fundamentally good (absolutely good)/(Light of Christ)

Rulers should seek for moral righteousness, not profit.
People are the foundation of the state. 

**Xunzi**:
Later student of Confucianism. 

Saw some of the worst fighting in the Warring States period.
Humans are naturally selfish and are only capable of reform via strict laws and effort. 

Formed the bases for the Legalist school of thought, which was founded by two of his students 
- Strict laws were needed for a strong state
- Enforcement among **all** classes
- State-sanctioned literature allowed

### Daoism/Taoism

*Dao*, "the way", is the first principle beyond the universe. 
- Beyond everything, unites everything
- Focus is on the individual and with nature and harmony
- Humans are a part of nature, should only act in accordance with nature
- Non-action/no desires

Less government is better.
- Provide a way for the people to be good and let them alone.
