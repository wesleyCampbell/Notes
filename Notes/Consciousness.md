Altered Forms of Consciousness:
- A shift in quality, control of, or organization of thoughts
- Distracted in some way

The Cocktail Party Effect:
- Not paying attention, but you hear your name in the background. 

The brain cannot multitask, not a parallel processor.
It functions the same as python multithreading.

### Sleep

**Biology**:

A biological rhythm. 

The *Circadian Rhythm*: the sleep-wake cycle.

Controlled by the *hypothalamus*. As daylight fades, the *suprachiasmatic* (SCN) secretes the hormone *melatonin*.

Melatonin regulates the *circadian rhythm.*
- Is controlled by light.
	- Blue and white light are the most potent.
	- Red light doesn't have an impact.
- Controlled by the Clock gene.
- Makes you sleepy, but does not keep you asleep. 


Larks vs Owls:
Controlled by the clock gene.

Larks:
- Would not enjoy evening classes
- Doesn't make naps

Owls:
- Struggle to report morning news
- Fall asleep in morning classes
- Takes naps

**Sleep Recording**:
Electroencephalogram (EEG):
- Measures the electrical activity of the brain 
- Frequency of waves
- Amplitude of waves

**Stages of Sleep**:

Each sleep cycle lasts approximately 90 minutes. 

Brain Activity:
- Beta waves when a person is wide awake
- Alpha waves when a person is drowsy
- Theta waves during N1 and N2
- Delta waves in deepest stages of sleep.

Two kinds of sleep:
1. REM (rapid eye movement)
2. NREM (non-rapid eye movement)

REM:
- Psychologically active
- Where dreaming takes place
- Voluntary muscles are inhibited
- Psychologically restful

NREM:
- Deeper and more restful
- Free to move around
- Physical Restful

#### N1: Light Sleep

Theta waves increase.
*Hypnogogic hallucinations*: People don't know they are asleep and interpret what they see as real.
*Hypnic Jerk*: You give a big jerk while drifting off to sleep.

#### N2: Sleep Spindles

Theta waves still.
Body temp drops, heart rate slows, breathing becomes shallower.
Has brief bursts of neurological activity called *sleep spindles*.

#### N3: 

Delta waves roll in at this stage.
Deep sleep.
Growth hormones are released. 

#### N2: 

Briefly goes back to the N2 stage

### REM (R):

Beta waves.
Body temp rises, eyes move rapidly, heart rate increases.
Where dreams take place.
Infants take more time in REM to form neurons.

### Sleep Disorders

**Sleep Deprivation**:
Think less clearly.
More accidents. 


**Nightmares**:

Children have more nightmares because they are in REM sleep for longer.

**Night Terrors**:

A state of panic experienced while you are asleep.
Happens in NREM sleep.
More common in children.
Runs in families. 

**Sleepwalking**:

Many people sleepwalk as children, but grow out of it as they grow up.
Also referred to as somnambulism.

**Insomnia**:

The inability to get quality sleep. 
- Waking after sleep has started but before the desired waking time
- Difficulty falling asleep.

**Sleep Apnea**:

You stop breathing for 10 seconds or more while sleeping. 
Can cause heart problems as well as poor sleep quality. 

**Narcolepsy**:

You slip into REM sleep throughout the day. 
Excessive daytime sleepiness after sufficient sleep.

**Cataplexy**:
symptom of narcolepsy.
Give in to sudden muscular weakness triggered by strong emotions.
Thought to be a result of orexin loss.

### Dreams

Freud believed that he could analyze dreams to diagnose patients. 

**The Brain and Activation-Synthesis Theory**:
- The result of brain activity in the pons; it sends random signals to the upper parts of the brain. 
- The thalamus then relays the signals to the cortex, which makes a story.

**The Activation-Information-Mode (AIM) Model
- Information that is accessed during waking hours can influence the dream.

Women tend to dream about people they know, both male and female.
Men tend to dream about other males, unfamiliar settings, weapons, tools, cars, and roads.

### Hypnosis

Hypnosis is a state of consciousness where a person is especially susceptible to suggestion.

Four stages:
1. "Focus on what's being said"
2. "Feel tired and relaxed"
3. "Let go, accept suggestions easily"
4. "Use vivid imagination"

It is theorized that there is a "hidden observer" that is aware of what we are doing while the hyptonized part of the mind is not.

### Meditation

Refocuses attention and achieves a trancelike state of consciousness.
It is known to take attention away from pain, reduce stress levels, and lower blood pressure. 

---

### Psychoactive Drugs

Different effects are a result of different neurotransmitter systems on which they work.

Narcotics -- codeine, morphine, heroin
Endorphins -- opiates and opioids
Cocaine

**Dependence**
Drugs can cause the body to crave it. Eventually, the body is unable to function without it.

One sign of this is a tolerance for that drug.
Another is experiencing withdrawals. 

The brain also releases a large amount of dopamine.
The dopamine receptors will decrease, meaning you need more of the drug for the same effect.

Some drugs cause *psychological dependence*:
People think that they need the drug, so they keep taking it.

**Tolerance**
Decreased sensitivity to a drug due to exposure.
**Withdrawal**:
Physical symptoms from lack of the substance
**Negative Reinforcement**:
taking the drug removes the withdrawal symptoms


**The Three most addictive drugs**:
- Heroin
- Smoking
- Alcohol

**Different Types of Drugs:**
1. Stimulants
2. Depressants
3. Hallucinogens


**Neurotransmitters of sleep:**
Adenosine:
Benedrodyl 


### Stimulants:

Stimulants cause the sympathetic or central nervous systems to increase their level of functioning. 

**Amphetamines (Speed)**:
- Adderall
- Benzedrine
- Methedrine 
- Dexedrine
- Nicotine (separate systems)
- Crack
- Caffeine

Amphetamines cause the sympathetic nervous system to go into overdrive. 
Decreases the appetite.
Cause people to burn up their energy reserves.
Produce alertness and concentration. 

**Cocaine**:
A natural drug that produces sensations of euphoria and energy.

Decreases the appetite.

No physical withdrawal symptoms, but people will experience a severe mood swing.

Works by releasing massive amounts of dopamine in the pleasure centers in the brain.
It prohibits reuptake.

**Nicotine**:
A mild stimulant that produces a slight "rush".

Very addicting. 
It is identified as one of the most addictive drugs due to its rapid arrival in the brain.
Call back to the *sledge-hammer* effect.
Ease of delivery.

**Caffeine**:
Natural substance.
Some studies state it might be healthy in small doses.
Most commonly used psychotropic drug.

### Depressants

**Tranquilizers**:
Barbiturates are strong

Benzodiazepines are weaker. (Roofies)

**Alcohol**:
The most commonly used depressant.

*The sledge-hammer effect*: Drinking very quickly so the alcohol level rises rapidly in the brain. It hits the nucleus accumbent like a sledge hammer. 

How much is too much?
2-3 drinks is safe, typically

**Narcotics**:
Releases dopamine.

**Opiates** (Narcotic):
Suppresses the sensation of pain. 

**Opium (Narcotic)**
Relieves pain and induces euphoria.
Made from the opium poppy.

**Morphine (Narcotic)**:
A form of opium, morphine can control severe pain.
Initially believed to cure a variety of maladies. Wildly used in the 60s. 

**Heroin (Narcotic)**:
A derivative of morphine.
Even more addictive than morphine and opium.

**Opioids**:
Synthetically created drugs that act like Opiates
- Methadone
- Oxycodone
- Hydrocodone
- Fentanyl

They are addictive.

### Hallucinogens

Hallucinogens cause the brain to alter its interpretation of sensation.

**LSD**:
A synthetic drug.
Provides a high, but does not act on the dopamine system.
Can either take you on a good "trip" or a bad one.
Alters your ability to perceive reality. 

**PCP**:
Synthetic.
Can be a hallucinogen, a stimulant, a depressant, or an analgesic drug, depending on the dosage. 
Known as angel dust.

**MDMA**:
Synthetic.
An amphetamine that can produce hallucinations. 

Releases a large amount of serotonin.

**Ecstasy**:
Street name: Molly
Produces feelings of energy, euphoria, emotional and social warmth, and empathy. 
Distorts time perception.
Neurotoxic (kills neurons)
- leads to lesions
- axonal death
- seizures. 

**Marijuana**:
Natural, comes from a form of hemp.
Has some medical properties. 
No physical dependency, but a powerful psychological dependence.
