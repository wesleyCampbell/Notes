Describes the state of rotating objects

Inertia, defined by $I$, describes how hard it is to rotate something.
$$
I = \sum{m_ir_i^2} = \int{r^2dm} = cmr^2
$$
where $c$ is some constant

Rotational kinematics:
$$ \omega = \frac{d\theta}{dt} $$
$$ \alpha = \frac{d\omega}{dt} = \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} $$

Tangential velocity:
$$ v_t = \omega r $$

Rotational Kinetic Energy:
$$ K_{rot} = \frac 12 I \omega^2 $$
