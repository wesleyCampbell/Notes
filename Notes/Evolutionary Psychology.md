Evolutionary psychology focuses on the evolutionary purposes and biological reasons for what we do. Also known as *Functionalism*: what are the functions of our actions and behaviors? 
- How does the mind help us *survive*?
- Behavior is seen as having an adaptive or survival value

For example:
- Why do the vast majority of people fall in love with the opposite sex? To pass on their genes.
- Why are guys impatient and quick to escalate a relationship while women are coy and slow? Women both have to bear the baby and have limited opportunities to have a baby. Men, on the other hand, have a crazy amount of sperm.
