#### Fugue

- Imitative Polyphony:
	- First voice states melody
	- Other instruments imitate it at different pitches
- Begins with the exposition:
	-  Voice one states the subject (melody)
	- Voice 2 then restates the subject while voice 1 provides support
	- Voice 3 then restates the subject while voices 1-2 provide support
	- Voice n then restates the subject while voices 1 ... n-1 provide support
- Moves on to the episode:
	- Takes the subject and makes alterations to it. Spice things up a little.
	- hey might invert it (flip it upside down), augment it (make notes longer), shorten the notes, or fragment it
	- Can also add in more new material
- Next is the Subject Return
- Then another episode followed by a subject return, etc.

## Compositional Techniques

The baroque era introduced solely instrumental music. 
Modern instruments were mostly established.
Much more structured than previous eras

### Bass Lines

###### Basso Continuoso
- Keyboard player given the bass line
- Keyboard player expected to add chords to the bass line

###### Walking Bass
- Every note the bass clef plays is the same length

###### Ground Bass
- The bass plays the same notes over and over and over again (THE WORST)
