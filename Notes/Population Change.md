## Population Change

Individuals of the same species living in the same geographical area

#### Population Size:
- Matters
- Is dynamic, never static
- Increases:
	- Births
	- Immigration
- Decreases:
	- Deaths
	- Emigration
- The total increase - the total decrease equals the change in population size

#### Biotic Potential:
- The max rate of population increase of a population
- Perfect conditions
- Max birth rate
- min death rate
- **Influential Factors of Biotic Potential**:
	- Age of reproduction (8 hours to 100 years)
	- Frequency of Reproduction (4 months to 11 years)
	- The number of offspring in each reproductive events
	- Reproductive life span (5 minutes vs. 72 years)
	- Death rate under normal conditions

#### Exponential Growth:
- More births than deaths
- E.g. more increase than decrease

## Population Regulation

Exponential growth is not indefinite

#### Boom/Bust Cycles
- Starts with a huge population growth 
- Followed by a *huge* crash
- New habitat invasion
- Increase in resources

#### Environmental Resistance:
- Environmental Limits on population growth
- Anything that prevents the biotic potential from occurring
- Competition, predators, parasitism, 
- Resource availability
- Living and non-living
- K = carrying capacity
- The carrying capacity is the max number that a habitat can sustain without a negative effects
- The exponential curve flattens out into an "S" shape
- Dynamic
- Density dependent and density independent

#### Density Independent:
- Weather 
- Climate
- Human activities 

#### Density Dependent:
- Based on availability of resources
- Predation:
	- As prey increases, predators increase
	- As predators increase, pray decrease
- Parasitism:
	- More successful in high-density hosts
- Competition:
	- Interspecific Between individuals of different species
	- Intraspecific: between individuals of the same species

## Population Distribution

#### Clumped:
- Any organism that lives in groups
- Social
- Resources

#### Uniform:
- Usually stable amount of space between individuals
- Territorial Organisms
- Can be seasonal

#### Random:
- Rare
- No social groups
- Resources are not limited

## Survivorship Patterns

#### Early Loss:
- High numbers of offspring
- Little or no parental care
- Death Rate is high on the young

#### Constant Loss:
- Constant chance of dying at any age

#### Late Loss:
- Most of the death occurs at the end of life
- Tremendous amount of parental care
- Small numbers of offspring
