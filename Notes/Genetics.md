## Terminology

###### Gene:
- A unit of inheritance
- Some length of DNA that codes for a particular trait

###### Locus (Loci):
- The physical location of a gene on a chromosome.

###### Allele:
- Different versions of the same gene
- At a specific locus
- E.g. Attached vs non-attached earlobes is a one-gene two-allele system
- AA, Aa, aa
- **Homozygous Alleles:**
	- Same alleles on both homologous chromosomes
	- AA | aa
- **Heterozygous Alleles**:
	- Different alleles on homologous chromosomes
	- Aa / hybrid


###### Codons
- The genetic code
- Read in 3 base groups
- mRNA triplets are called codons
- tRNA complimentary bases are called anticodons

## RNA

Three types of RNA

###### mRNA:
- Messenger RNA
- Transcribes the DNA and moves it out of the nucleus to the ribosomes

###### tRNA:
- Translation RNA
- Takes the transcription from the mRNA and translates it into the complimentary sequence.
- Builds the Protiens using amino acids

###### rRNA:
- Ribosomal RNA
- Lives in the ribosomes
- Helps with the transcription process

## DNA Transcription

###### Overview:
- Code from the DNA is transcribed into mRNA
- Occurs in the nucleus
- Base sequence that is complimentary to DNA strand
- tRNA base sequence is complimentary to mRNA base sequence
- Read in codons (groups of three)

###### The Initialization Process:
- RNA Polymerase binds to the beginning of a gene at the promoter region on the DNA (Enzyme acts as a starter key in the ignition)
- Double stranded DNA is "unzipped" by the RNA Polymerase
- Initialization

###### Elongation
- The RNA Polymerase moves down one strand
- Template Strand:
	- DNA strand the RNA polymerase uses to build a complimentary strand of mRNA

###### Termination:
- DNA termination signal (end) causes the RNA polymerase to let go
- DNA zipped back together
- The mRNA molecule is released
- The RNA polymerase moves on to the next gene

###### mRNA Modification
- DNA is transcribed into mRNA
- more RNA nucleotides add a "cap" and "tail" to the mRNA molecule
	- Prevents degradation in the scary cytoplasm
- Introns ("Non coding" regions) are cut out
	- Why bother synthesizing introns that are cut out later?
	- There are many possible splicing arrangements = many possible proteins from a single gene
	- Introns are the groovy place for evolution (change) of new proteins
	- Exons can change places during splicing
	- Accidental, non-directive
	- The result is a brand new protein that is either harmful or beneficial or neutral
- Exons pasted together
- mRNA finished product then leaves the nucleus

## DNA Translation

###### Overview:
- mRNA code is decoded into tRNA, then translated into amino acid sequences of the proteins

###### Initiation
- In Cytoplasm
- Complex of small ribosomal subunits, a start tRNA, and the proteins binds to start of mRNA strand
- Large ribosomal subunit binds to small subunit
- Small subunits bind to the start of the mRNA (ribosomal, tRNA, and proteins)

###### Elongation:
- Each codon of the mRNA is paired with an anti-codon of tRNA
- Bond between the tRNA and amino acid is broken: 
- The tRNA reads one codon, makes the amino acid, releases the amino acid, and then moves onto the next codon
- Bond formed with previous amino acid is chain
- Amino acid chain builds

###### Termination
- Chain continues to build until the stop codon is reached
- mRNA and amino acid chain is released
- Ribosome subunits separate
