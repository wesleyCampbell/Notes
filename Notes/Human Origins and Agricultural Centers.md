## Overview

The church has no official stance on evolution. "The scriptures tell us why man was created, but they do not tell how" 

>What the church requires is only belief 'that Adam was the first man of what we would call the human race.' Scientists can speculate on the rest.
>-Gordan B. Hinckley

Prehistory can be divided into three phases:
- The Origins of Modern Humanity
- The Origins of Agricultural Centers
- The Origins of Empires

#### Origin of Humanity

Humans originated from Africa. By the time they spread abroad, they had the technological capacity for stone and bone tools and jewelry made of shells. They were able to understand symbolism and had several religious symbols. They defined a civilization that was worldwide.

When the last ice age came, it separated the groups from each other. Isolation allowed for each group to develop its own culture and technology.

#### Origin of Agricultural Centers

Once the global climate had stabilized, agricultural centers began to develop in the
- Middle East
- South and East Asia
- Americas

Foragers from the Middle East wandered until they were situated below mountains. The runoff from those mountains allowed for good agricultural practice. By skillful breeding of seeds, they were able to domesticate wheat, barely, rice, millet, and corn. Similarly, they were able to breed animals for similar purpose.

The first centralized agricultural centers developed in irrigated river valleys, from which emerged structured societies with kings and rulers.


#### The Origins of Empires

After people outside these agricultural centers adapted to agricultural practices, they were able to use their bronze tools to connect the three centers in Middle East, India, and China. These *steppe* peoples acted as the intermediary between the three groups.
Eventually, empires rose.
During the same period, the agricultural centers in the Americas and Africa were developing more slowly, mostly resulting in small towns and rarely, small kingdoms.
