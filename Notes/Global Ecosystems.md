## Ecosystems

#### Definition

Everything living and non-living within a geographical boundary

Comprised of:
- Species
- populations
- community
- climate
- weather
- topography
- geology
- chemistry
- ect.

Large-scale processes

All these factors interact to produce an ecosystem

#### Ecosystem Predictors

###### Climate
- Long-term weather patterns of region
- The temperate, dry climate of Utah
- Warm, humid climate of Florida

###### Planetary Characteristics 
- Tilt of the earth is responsible for seasons
- Rotation Effects:
	- Planetary air currents produce predictable climates
- Planetary water currents produce predictable marine climates

###### Land Topography:
- Air rises up and over mountains
- Precipitation on leading side (north), less on "shadow" side (south)

## Biodiversity Patterns and Climate

#### Species Distribution 

Dependent on temperature and water availability

Not the same everywhere

Biomes:
- Characteristic conditions and plant communities

###### Tropical Rain Forests:
- Equatorial
- Warm constant temps
- Huge amount of rainfall
- The most biodiversity on the entire planet (possibly 50%)
- Most nutrients are stored in the vegetation, not the soil
	- Cut down and burn vegetation, the soil is mostly infertile
	- Many attempts at large-scale agriculture have failed

###### Tropical Deciduous Forests:
- Intermittent rainfall
- Distinct wet/dry season
- Parts of Florida and extreme Southeast ("swamp")

###### Tropical Scrub/Savanna
- Little rainfall
- Still have monsoons
- Intermittent trees
- mostly grasses

###### Deserts:
- Almost no rainfall (less than 10 inches/year)
- Can be very hot or can be very cold
- Amazing adaptations

###### Chaparral:
- All of the little rainfall comes in cool winters
- Mostly shrubs
- Not much bio-diversity

###### Grasslands:
- Tall and short-grass prairie
- Continuous grass cover

###### Temperate Deciduous Forests:
- Sub-freezing winters
- Enough rainfall to support trees

###### Temperate Rain Forests
- Costal regious
- Very moist
- Moderate temps
- around 50 inches / year
- things grow on things

###### Taiga
- Northern coniferous
- short growing season
- Precipitation mostly snow

###### Tundra
- Treeless
- Extremely short growing season
- harsh winters
- low rainfall
- Permafrost prevents water absorption

###### Freshwater Zones:
- Littoral: 
	- Shoreline
	- Abundant Light
- Limnetic:
	- Mid-water column
	- Still photosynthetic
- Profundal:
	- No photosynthesis
	- survive on material that sinks down from below
- Two types of lakes:
	- Oligotrophic
		- low nutrient 
		- cold
		- clear
	- Eutrophic:
		- High nutrient
		- Warmer
		- Low oxygen
