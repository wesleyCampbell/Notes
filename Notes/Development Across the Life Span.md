### Research Designs

**Cross-Sectional Design:**
Compares different participants of various ages. 

**Longitudinal Design:**
Studies the same participants over a long period of time. This takes lots of time, money, and management. 

**Cross-Sequential Design:**
Different participants of various ages are compared at several points of time.

### Nature vs. Nurture

How much of our behavior is due to our biology?
How much is determined by our environmental influences?

*Behavioral Genetics* studies this question. 
Look for similar traits in blood-relatives and traits that are not passed down in adoptions. 
Twin studies. 

Research has found that it is not entirely nature and not entirely nurture. It is a combination of both.

### Building Blocks of Development

Genetics is the science of heredity. 

**DNA**:
> DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid

DNA is comprised of two long sugar-phosphate strands linked to each other by amines or bases. 
The amines are organic structures that contain the genetic code for building proteins. 

**Genes**:
Each section of DNA containing a certain sequence is a gene. 
Dominant and recessive genes. Often, genetic disorders are recessive genes.

| DD  | Dd  |
| --- | --- |
| dD  | dd  |

For a recessive gene to manifest, there must not be a dominant gene present. 

Made of alleles. 
Allele is the half of the gene you get from one parent. 

Genotype: One's genetic make-up.
Genes that have differences in allele variants. 

Phenotype:
An organism's observable traits (red hair, body type, etc.)

**Chromosomes**:
Rod-shaped structures found in the nucleus of every cell in the body. 
They are tightly wound strands of genes. 
Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes: 23 from the sperm and 23 from the eggs.

Code for pieces of amino acids that are assembled into larger proteins.
Your genes are made from alleles. 

Some disorders are due to the chromosomes rather than the genes.
Some include:
- Down syndrome
	- Intellectual disability
- Turner's syndrome
	- Extra male chromosome 
- Klinefelter's syndrome

### Fertilization:

From conception to birth is approximately 38 weeks. 

**Zygote**:
After the egg and the sperm unite, they form a single cell called a *zygote*.
The Zygote will divide into two cells, then 4, then 8, and so on. 

**Twins**:
*Monozygotic Twins*, or identical twins, come from one fertilized egg. Early in the division process, the zygote splits into two separate masses. 

*Dizygotic Twins* come when a woman's body releases two eggs. 

Bioethics. 

Twins allow us to research the nature vs. nurture question.

### Three Stages of Development

**The Germinal Period**:
A 2-week period where the zygote begins to divide and attaches itself to the uterus wall.
The placenta and umbilical cord begin to develop. 
Generates stem cells.
Cells begin to differentiate, becoming specialized.

**The Embryonic Period**:
After being firmly attached to the uterus wall, the zygote becomes known as an embryo.
Lasts from 2 weeks to 8 weeks, for 6 weeks in total.

If there is testosterone, make a male. Otherwise, make a female.

The cells continue to specialize, becoming the various organs and structures of a human.
By the end of the period, the embryo is ~1in long.
Has eyes, nose, lips, teeth, arms and legs, and a heart.

There are certain periods dedicated to each structure, and the mother's nourishment can have an impact on those areas during those time periods. 
Substances that can cause a birth defect are known as *teratogens*.

**The Fetal Period**:
Lasts from 8 weeks to birth.

The fetus's length increases by about 20 times and its weight increases by 7 pounds.
The organs continue to develop, becoming functional.
Teratogens impact the functionality rather than structure during this time.

38 weeks is considered full term. 
Babies born before 37 weeks are considered preterm, and may need life support. 

**Teratogens**:
Effect is dependent upon:
- Timing
- Dose
- Type of substance
- Maternal individual differences

### Infantile Development

After birth, the infant's respiratory system begins to function.
Blood begins to circulate. 
Body temp is regulated with excess fat
The digestive system is stalled for a while.

Infants have innate reflexes, helping it survive.

Motor development occurs from birth to 2 years. 

**Brain Development**:
At birth, the brain consists of 100 billion neurons. 
The brain triples in size from 0 to 3 years of age. 
Synaptic pruning, removing unused synaptic connections.

**Sensory Development**:
*Preferential Looking*: The more an infant looks at a stimulus, the more it will prefer it.

Most sensory abilities are well developed at birth.
Some take time to reach full power. 

Smell and taste are very developed. 
Hearing can take some time to fully reach its potential.
Vision is the least functional sense, infants can take 6 months to see color.

### Cognitive Development
Jean Piaget developed a theory of cognitive development. 

*Schemas* are the frames of reference we use. 

Assimilation, previous knowledge is used to try and understand the new event.
Accommodation is altering or adjusting old schemas to fit new information. 

There are four stages of cognitive development:
1. Sensorimotor
2. Preoperational
3. Concrete Operations
4. Formal Operations

**Sensorimotor**
- Lasts from birth to 2 years.
- Infants use their senses and motor abilities to learn about the world.
- Begin deliberately interacting with objects.
- Develops object permanence.
- Symbolic thought becomes possible. 

**Preoperational**:
- Lasts from 2 to 7 years.
- Can ask questions.
- Can explore their world more fully.
- Pretending becomes possible.
- Not capable of logical thought.
- Believe everything is alive and has feelings, animism. 
- Believe what they see.
- Unable to see the world through anyone else's eyes but their own, egocentrism.
- Overwhelmed by appearances, focusing only on one feature of an object, centration.
- Not able to understand conservation, cannot mentally reverse actions. (Irreversibility

**Concrete Operations**:
- Lasts from 7 to 12 years
- Capable of conservation and reversible thinking
- Centration no longer occurs, can now consider all relevant features.
- Think more logically about beliefs
- Convinced they know more than their parents
- Unable to deal effectively with abstract concepts. 

**Formal Operations**:
- Lasts from age 12 to adulthood
- Can think abstractly
- Get deeply involved with hypothetical thinking. 
- Piaget did not believe that everyone would reach formal operations.

People have proposed a 5th stage of development, relativistic thinking stage, where young adults recognize that not all problems can be solved with pure logic.

**The Stages of Cognitive Development:**
- Sensorimotor: Birth to 2 years
	- Explore the world using senses and ability to move
	- Develop object permanence.
	- Understand that concepts and images represent objects, people, and events.
- Preoperational: 2 to 7 years
	- Can mentally represent objects and events with words and pictures
	- Can pretend
	- Can't conserve, logically reason, or consider many characteristics of an object
- Concrete Operations: 7 to 12 years
	- Able to conserve and reverse their thinking
	- Able to classify objects in terms of many characteristics
	- Can think logically and understand analogies about concrete events
- Formal Operations: 12 years +
	- Can think abstractly about hypotheticals and logical possibilities
	
Piaget's study has been criticized on several points. Many people believe that it is not a stage based progression but a continuous flow. Preschoolers are not as egocentric as Piaget seemed to believed. He has also been criticized for only looking at the Western Culture.

**Vygotsky's Theory**:
While Piaget emphasized the importance of objects, Vygotsky emphasized the importance of people.

Vygotsky believed that children develop when someone else helps them, asking leading questions and providing examples. 
Scaffolding is a process where a highly skilled person gives someone more help in the beginning and then begins to withdraw that help.

Vygotsky proposed the theory of zone of proximal development (ZPD)
The ZPD is the difference of what the child can do alone and what a child can do with a teacher.
Private speech was a way for the child to think out loud.

### Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

A neurodevelopmental disorder encompassing a range of previous disorders that cause problems in thinking, feeling, language, and social skills. 

Research suggests that people with autism fail to recognize that other people have points of view, the ability to have beliefs, intentions, and desires. 

Possible causes are genetic mutations, the maternal grandmother smoking during pregnancy.
However, the cause is not really known.

### Psychosocial Development

**Temperament**:
The behavioral and emotional characteristics are fairly well established at birth.
Three basic temperaments have been identified for babies:
1. Easy
	- Regular in their schedules
	- Easily soothed and happy
2. Difficult
	- Irregular in their schedules
	- Unhappy about change
	- Loud, active, and crabby
3. Slow to warm up
	- Less grumpy, quieter, and more regular than difficult children
	- Slow to adapt to change
	- In between, so to speak

Temperamental styles can last well into adulthood.
Influenced by heredity.

**Attachment**:
The emotional bond that forms between an infant and its primary caregiver. 
Forms within the first 6 months.
Stranger anxiety and separation anxiety. 

Mary Ainsworth's Attachment Styles:
1. Secure
	- Willing to get down from their mother's lap after entering a room 
	- Explored happily
	- Periodically "touched base" with their mother
	- When the mother left, the infants got upset
	- When the mother returned, the infants were glad to see her
2. Avoidant
	- Willing to explore
	- Did not "touch base"
	- Ignored stranger and mother
3. Ambivalent:
	- Mixed feelings about something
	- Clingy
	- Unwilling to explore
	- Upset by presence of stranger
	- Hard to sooth
4. Disorganized
	- Unable to decide how to react to the mother's return
	- Approach her with eyes turned away

This relationship is dependent on how the mother treats the baby and on the baby's temperament. 

**Influences on Attachment**:
Quality of parenting ***In the home*** has a greater impact on positive development.

### Adolescent Development

The period of time from age 13 to early 20s.

Able to think about hypothetical situations.
Not yet completely free of egocentric thought. 

*Personal Fable*: Convinced that they are special, one of a kind.

*Imaginary Audience*: Convinced that everyone is looking at them, that they are always the center of everyone else's world. 

**Moral Development**:
- Preconventional Morality (small children):
	- Morality is based on the consequences. 
- Conventional Morality (older children, adolescents, and most adults):
	- An action is morally right if it conforms to the rules of the society
- Postconventional Morality (about one fifth of adult population):
	- Morality is determined by the experiences and judgment of the person. 
The above study has been criticized  for only studying males. 

**Erikson's Identity vs. Role Confusion**:
Teenagers must choose from many options for values in life and beliefs.
Teenagers who have resolved the conflicts within themselves are more equipped to find their own identity. They are less likely to give into peer pressure than those who have not.

### Adult Development

**Physical Aging**:
20s are the prime, but aging is already beginning. 
Oil glands in the neck and around the eyes begin to malfunction.

During the 30s, vision and hearing begin to decline, weight may increase.
During the 40s, that process continues, skin shows more wrinkles, hair turns gray, height begins to decrease.

During the 60s and 70s, hearing aids may become necessary.

Menopause:
During a woman's 40s, estrogen levels decline. Some women begin to experience "hot flashes".
At 51, most women will cease to ovulate altogether. 

Andropause:
During a man's 40s, testosterone levels begin to decline. Sperm count reduces. 

During the middle ages, many health problems first occur. 
Common problems include:
- High blood pressure
- Sleep problems
- Heart disease
- Lung disease
- Stroke
- Alzheimer's disease

**Cognitive Development**:
Intellectual abilities do not decline, but speed of processing does. 
People find themselves having a hard time recalling a particular word.

Those who are more active in early and middle adulthood seem to have better memory.
"Use it or lose it"

**Psychosocial Development**:
Erikson saw the primary task being to find a mate.
Young adults that have difficulty trusting others and who are unsure of their own identities may find isolation instead of intimacy.

Middle adulthood is focused on parenting. 

**Forms of Parenting**:
- Authoritarian Parenting:
	- Overly concerned with rules
	- Physical punishment
	- Children are often insecure, timid, withdrawn, and resentful.
- Permissive Parenting:
	- Very few demands on their behavior
	- Allowing the children to do what they want
	- Permissive indulgent's children can do no wrong. 
	- Children tend to be selfish, dependent, and immature
- Authoritative Parenting:
	- The sweet spot in the middle.
	- Sets understandable limits
	- Children tend to be self-reliant, independent, and more able to regulate their emotions

### Theories of Physical and Psychological Aging

**The Cellular-Clock Theory**:
Cells are limited in the number of times they can reproduce and repair damage.
Evidence for this theory is the existence of *telomeres*.
*Telomeres* are structures on the ends of chromosomes that shorten each time a cell reproduces. 

**Wear-and-Tear Theory**:
Outside influences such as stress, exertion, and damage influence our aging.
Body's organs and cell tissues wear out with repeated use and abuse. 
The damaged tissue accumulates, producing the effects of aging.

**Free-Radical Theory**:
Latest version of the wear and tear theory.
Free radicals are O2 molecules that have an unstable electron.
Free radicals steal electrons from other molecules, increasing the damage done to structures inside the cell.

**Activity Theory**:
Remaining active mitigates the effects of aging.

### Stages of Death

Elisabeth Kubler-Ross researched the stages of death.

She stated that there are 5 stages of reaction when faced with death.
1. Denial
2. Anger
3. Bargaining
4. Depression
5. Acceptance
