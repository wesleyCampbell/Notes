### Forces

A force is defined as a mass times an acceleration.
As acceleration is a vector, so is a force.

**Free Body Diagrams**
To display the forces acting upon an object, we use free-body diagrams:

### Newton's First Law

A body continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion along a straight line unless it is acted upon by some net unbalanced external force to change the state.

Or:

A body in motion stays in motion unless acted on by some outside force.

### Newton's Second Law

The net force acting upon a system is equal to the mass of the system times its acceleration:

$$F_{net}=\sum F  = ma$$

---

### Newton's Third Law

For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
Forces are created in pairs that face in opposite directions.
